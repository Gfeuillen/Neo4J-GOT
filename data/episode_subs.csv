"
2,2,3,"00:02:19,537","00:02:20,782","Boy.
"
2,2,4,"00:02:21,826","00:02:23,199","Lovely boy.
"
2,2,5,"00:02:23,857","00:02:25,030","What do you want?
"
2,2,6,"00:02:25,559","00:02:27,108","A man has a thirst.
"
2,2,7,"00:02:27,228","00:02:29,526","The man does not drink
for a day and a night.
"
2,2,8,"00:02:29,749","00:02:31,861","A boy could make a friend.
"
2,2,9,"00:02:32,120","00:02:33,387","I have friends.
"
2,2,10,"00:02:33,507","00:02:36,885","Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
"
2,2,11,"00:02:37,429","00:02:39,354","A man does not choose his companions.
"
2,2,12,"00:02:39,474","00:02:41,291","These two, they have no courtesy.
"
2,2,13,"00:02:41,619","00:02:43,263","A man must ask forgiveness.
"
2,2,14,"00:02:46,068","00:02:48,216","You're called Arry.
"
2,2,15,"00:02:50,813","00:02:53,536","This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.
"
2,2,16,"00:02:53,759","00:02:55,144","Once of the Free City of Lorath.
"
2,2,17,"00:02:55,264","00:02:57,069","Hey, you little shit.
"
2,2,18,"00:02:57,189","00:02:59,029","Get us beer!
"
2,2,19,"00:02:59,149","00:03:00,684","You should have asked nicely.
"
2,2,20,"00:03:05,789","00:03:07,503","Come closer.
"
2,2,21,"00:03:07,623","00:03:11,505","And I'll shove that stick up your
bunghole and fuck you bloody.
"
2,2,22,"00:03:11,625","00:03:13,747","The boy has more courage than sense.
"
2,2,23,"00:03:13,867","00:03:15,097","Come here!
"
2,2,24,"00:03:15,217","00:03:17,603","Yoren said none of us were
should go near of those three.
"
2,2,25,"00:03:17,885","00:03:19,188","They don't scare me.
"
2,2,26,"00:03:19,704","00:03:20,995","Then you're stupid.
"
2,2,27,"00:03:21,115","00:03:22,803","They scare me.
"
2,2,28,"00:03:27,049","00:03:29,713","Would a gold collector look
this far from King's Landing?
"
2,2,29,"00:03:34,784","00:03:35,852","What are you doing?
"
2,2,30,"00:03:35,892","00:03:36,920","They're looking for me.
"
2,2,31,"00:03:37,798","00:03:39,235","You're in command here?
"
2,2,32,"00:03:40,668","00:03:42,405","You're a long way from home.
"
2,2,33,"00:03:43,025","00:03:44,283","I asked you a question.
"
2,2,34,"00:03:44,884","00:03:46,058","Aye, you did.
"
2,2,35,"00:03:47,579","00:03:49,288","You asked without manners.
"
2,2,36,"00:03:49,853","00:03:51,599","And I chose not to answer.
"
2,2,37,"00:03:52,253","00:03:54,046","I have a royal warrant.
"
2,2,38,"00:03:55,267","00:03:57,877","For one of these gutter
rats you're transporting.
"
2,2,39,"00:04:00,911","00:04:02,901","Well the thing is,
"
2,2,40,"00:04:03,624","00:04:06,798","these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.
"
2,2,41,"00:04:07,197","00:04:09,939","That puts them beyond the
reach of kings and queens.
"
2,2,42,"00:04:12,408","00:04:13,883","It's a funny thing.
"
2,2,43,"00:04:14,003","00:04:16,099","People worry so much about their throats,
"
2,2,44,"00:04:16,136","00:04:18,221","they forget about what's down low.
"
2,2,45,"00:04:19,428","00:04:22,405","Now I sharpened this
blade before breakfast.
"
2,2,46,"00:04:23,241","00:04:26,377","I could shave a spider's
arse if I wanted to.
"
2,2,47,"00:04:27,306","00:04:28,208","Or,
"
2,2,48,"00:04:28,457","00:04:30,748","I could nick this artery in your leg
"
2,2,49,"00:04:30,868","00:04:35,377","and once it's nicked, there's no one
around here who knows how to un-nick it.
"
2,2,50,"00:04:37,240","00:04:39,061","We'll just keep that.
"
2,2,51,"00:04:41,014","00:04:43,258","Good steel is always needed on the wall.
"
2,2,52,"00:04:44,104","00:04:45,869","Seems you have a choice.
"
2,2,53,"00:04:46,542","00:04:49,960","You can die here at this
crossroads a long way from home.
"
2,2,54,"00:04:50,307","00:04:52,729","Or you can go back to your
city and tell your masters
"
2,2,55,"00:04:52,767","00:04:55,114","you didn't find what you were looking for.
"
2,2,56,"00:05:01,376","00:05:03,319","We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
"
2,2,57,"00:05:03,864","00:05:05,817","He carries a bull's head helmet.
"
2,2,58,"00:05:06,786","00:05:10,344","Anyone turning him over will
earn the King's reward.
"
2,2,59,"00:05:10,947","00:05:13,510","We'll be back. With more men.
"
2,2,60,"00:05:13,630","00:05:16,562","And I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.
"
2,2,61,"00:05:30,865","00:05:33,006","(Tyrion whistling)
"
2,2,62,"00:05:46,380","00:05:47,488","(woman laughing)
"
2,2,63,"00:05:51,204","00:05:52,443","My lord.
"
2,2,64,"00:05:52,472","00:05:53,871","You make me wait a long time.
"
2,2,65,"00:05:53,908","00:05:55,805","And your friend keeps me company.
"
2,2,66,"00:05:56,622","00:05:58,453","We were just speaking of your bravery
"
2,2,67,"00:05:58,573","00:06:01,373","in the victory against the
Stark auxiliary forces.
"
2,2,68,"00:06:02,597","00:06:04,034","It was quite a battle.
"
2,2,69,"00:06:05,104","00:06:08,203","I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
"
2,2,70,"00:06:08,503","00:06:11,423","The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
"
2,2,71,"00:06:11,896","00:06:14,291","And I tell him the story of how we meet.
"
2,2,72,"00:06:15,173","00:06:18,967","To find such a lovely creature
working in your father's kitchen.
"
2,2,73,"00:06:19,417","00:06:21,314","It almost beggars belief.
"
2,2,74,"00:06:22,112","00:06:23,455","Strange things do happen.
"
2,2,75,"00:06:24,394","00:06:26,234","You should taste her fish pie.
"
2,2,76,"00:06:26,704","00:06:28,985","I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
"
2,2,77,"00:06:29,105","00:06:30,450","How can you tell?
"
2,2,78,"00:06:30,657","00:06:31,934","I can always tell.
"
2,2,79,"00:06:32,433","00:06:35,635","Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.
"
2,2,80,"00:06:36,180","00:06:37,738","We'll make a fisherman of him yet.
"
2,2,81,"00:06:38,724","00:06:42,940","I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.
"
2,2,82,"00:06:43,721","00:06:46,603","Friends are such an important part of life.
"
2,2,83,"00:06:47,721","00:06:50,406","Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.
"
2,2,84,"00:06:50,716","00:06:52,472","But rest easy my lord,
"
2,2,85,"00:06:53,304","00:06:56,807","I am very good at keeping
secrets for my good friends.
"
2,2,86,"00:06:57,605","00:06:59,455","Your discretion is legendary,
"
2,2,87,"00:06:59,915","00:07:00,854","where your friends are concerned.
"
2,2,88,"00:07:01,237","00:07:05,810","How unspeakable of me to go on and
on, when all you want to do is rest.
"
2,2,89,"00:07:05,930","00:07:06,683","I will leave you.
"
2,2,90,"00:07:09,115","00:07:11,448","Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.
"
2,2,91,"00:07:11,568","00:07:14,293","The city is made brighter by your presence.
"
2,2,92,"00:07:14,413","00:07:16,377","We have a council meeting, my lord.
"
2,2,93,"00:07:20,137","00:07:21,395","I don't like threats.
"
2,2,94,"00:07:22,261","00:07:23,538","Who threatened you?
"
2,2,95,"00:07:23,658","00:07:26,473","I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.
"
2,2,96,"00:07:26,593","00:07:29,260","Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.
"
2,2,97,"00:07:29,380","00:07:32,339","Threaten me again and I will
have you thrown into the sea.
"
2,2,98,"00:07:35,646","00:07:38,145","You might be disappointed in the results.
"
2,2,99,"00:07:38,810","00:07:40,871","The storms come and go.
"
2,2,100,"00:07:41,244","00:07:43,058","The big fish eat the little fish.
"
2,2,101,"00:07:43,178","00:07:45,630","And I keep on paddling.
"
2,2,102,"00:07:47,103","00:07:48,599","Come, my lord.
"
2,2,103,"00:07:48,719","00:07:51,517","We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
"
2,2,104,"00:07:56,516","00:08:00,073","From this time until the end of time,
we are not part of your realm,
"
2,2,105,"00:08:00,193","00:08:03,410","but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North.
"
2,2,106,"00:08:07,475","00:08:09,809","He has more spirit than his
father, I'll give him that.
"
2,2,107,"00:08:09,929","00:08:12,672","You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.
"
2,2,108,"00:08:13,019","00:08:16,830","Give him his father's bones back, at
least as a gesture of good faith.
"
2,2,109,"00:08:17,240","00:08:19,228","You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
"
2,2,110,"00:08:20,003","00:08:21,827","I will, Your Grace.
"
2,2,111,"00:08:22,958","00:08:25,347","Did you see my brother when
you were the Starks guest?
"
2,2,112,"00:08:25,467","00:08:26,496","I did.
"
2,2,113,"00:08:26,929","00:08:28,826","They have not broken his
spirit, Your Grace.
"
2,2,114,"00:08:30,066","00:08:31,817","If you speak with him,
"
2,2,115,"00:08:33,348","00:08:34,917","tell him he's not been forgotten.
"
2,2,116,"00:08:35,700","00:08:36,886","I will, Your Grace.
"
2,2,117,"00:08:37,006","00:08:38,117","Safe travels, cousin.
"
2,2,118,"00:08:42,541","00:08:44,620","You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
"
2,2,119,"00:08:44,740","00:08:45,715","If that's everything?
"
2,2,120,"00:08:45,835","00:08:50,511","A raven flew in this
morning from Castle Black.
"
2,2,121,"00:08:50,784","00:08:52,809","Trouble with the wildlings?
"
2,2,122,"00:08:52,929","00:08:55,318","That's why they're called wildlings.
"
2,2,123,"00:08:55,438","00:08:57,397","Somewhat less wild these days.
"
2,2,124,"00:08:57,890","00:09:01,245","It seems they've stopped killing each
other and started following this
"
2,2,125,"00:09:01,365","00:09:02,632","King-Beyond-the-Wall.
"
2,2,126,"00:09:02,752","00:09:06,612","Another king? How many is that now?
Five? I've lost count.
"
2,2,127,"00:09:07,086","00:09:10,499","Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man The Wall.
"
2,2,128,"00:09:10,619","00:09:13,835","Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.
"
2,2,129,"00:09:13,955","00:09:18,282","Cold winds are rising, and
the dead rise with them.
"
2,2,130,"00:09:18,402","00:09:21,730","The northerners are a superstitious people.
"
2,2,131,"00:09:22,157","00:09:25,662","According to the Commander, one of these
dead men attacked him in his chambers.
"
2,2,132,"00:09:26,033","00:09:27,799","Mormont doesn't lie.
"
2,2,133,"00:09:28,455","00:09:30,535","How do you kill a dead man?
"
2,2,134,"00:09:31,319","00:09:33,069","Apparently you burn him.
"
2,2,135,"00:09:34,364","00:09:36,352","One trip to The Wall and you come back
"
2,2,136,"00:09:36,472","00:09:40,255","believing in grumpkins and snarks.
"
2,2,137,"00:09:40,375","00:09:42,175","I don't know what I believe,
"
2,2,138,"00:09:42,295","00:09:44,466","but here's a fact for you.
"
2,2,139,"00:09:45,058","00:09:47,538","The Night's Watch is the
only thing that separates us
"
2,2,140,"00:09:47,658","00:09:49,020","from what lies beyond the Wall.
"
2,2,141,"00:09:49,140","00:09:53,762","I have every confidence the brave men of
the Night's Watch will protect us all.
"
2,2,142,"00:09:55,324","00:09:56,983","Night, sir.
"
2,2,143,"00:09:57,103","00:09:59,163","The gods wanted us to have dignity,
"
2,2,144,"00:09:59,283","00:10:01,096","wouldn't make us fart when we died.
"
2,2,145,"00:10:03,041","00:10:04,500","We fart when we die?
"
2,2,146,"00:10:05,339","00:10:09,351","My blessed mother was holding her
own when she left this world.
"
2,2,147,"00:10:09,716","00:10:12,159","She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
"
2,2,148,"00:10:12,998","00:10:16,153","(farting noises)
"
2,2,149,"00:10:21,691","00:10:24,882","Seems a bit greedy for one
man to have so many wives.
"
2,2,150,"00:10:25,002","00:10:27,436","We were having a serious discussion.
"
2,2,151,"00:10:27,800","00:10:29,588","Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
"
2,2,152,"00:10:31,448","00:10:33,363","Would you look at that.
"
2,2,153,"00:10:34,776","00:10:37,329","Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.
"
2,2,154,"00:10:37,449","00:10:39,809","I prefer watching them come towards me.
"
2,2,155,"00:10:40,380","00:10:42,149","I'm sure that's nice too.
"
2,2,156,"00:10:42,269","00:10:43,972","Well, there was a milkmaid
"
2,2,157,"00:10:44,194","00:10:46,773","named Violet on the next farm
over from where I grew up.
"
2,2,158,"00:10:47,562","00:10:50,754","And we were wrestling together from
the time we were six years old.
"
2,2,159,"00:10:51,091","00:10:52,568","And then we got older,
"
2,2,160,"00:10:53,106","00:10:57,683","the wrestling, uh changed.
"
2,2,161,"00:10:58,002","00:11:00,044","You were with her?
"
2,2,162,"00:11:00,591","00:11:02,087","How many times?
"
2,2,163,"00:11:02,561","00:11:04,275","Well, as many times as I could.
"
2,2,164,"00:11:07,516","00:11:09,739","Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
"
2,2,165,"00:11:09,859","00:11:11,563","We need more potatoes.
"
2,2,166,"00:11:11,683","00:11:13,702","I'll get another sack for the sludge.
"
2,2,167,"00:11:17,014","00:11:18,692","Get the turnips too.
"
2,2,168,"00:11:30,226","00:11:33,111","No, Ghost, no!
"
2,2,169,"00:11:33,231","00:11:34,964","No.
"
2,2,170,"00:11:35,854","00:11:38,846","Ghost, away. Shoo.
Shoo!
"
2,2,171,"00:11:42,016","00:11:43,904","You all right?
"
2,2,172,"00:11:44,581","00:11:47,253","- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.
"
2,2,173,"00:11:47,373","00:11:50,458","Oh, oh. Right.
"
2,2,174,"00:11:51,359","00:11:54,167","I'm sorry. I just wanted to
make sure you weren't hurt.
"
2,2,175,"00:12:01,105","00:12:02,199","You're very brave.
"
2,2,176,"00:12:11,940","00:12:13,472","What's he doing?
"
2,2,177,"00:12:14,475","00:12:15,661","This is Gilly,
"
2,2,178,"00:12:15,781","00:12:18,661","she's one of Craster's daughters.
"
2,2,179,"00:12:19,099","00:12:20,795","Hello, Gilly. What's he doing?
"
2,2,180,"00:12:20,915","00:12:22,054","Sam said you could help.
"
2,2,181,"00:12:22,414","00:12:23,946","I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...
"
2,2,182,"00:12:24,066","00:12:25,095","She's pregnant.
"
2,2,183,"00:12:32,044","00:12:34,616","We have to take her with us, when we leave.
"
2,2,184,"00:12:34,736","00:12:35,692","What?
"
2,2,185,"00:12:36,494","00:12:38,217","I know it sounds a bit mad.
"
2,2,186,"00:12:38,337","00:12:40,059","No it doesn't sound a bit
mad, it's impossible.
"
2,2,187,"00:12:40,179","00:12:42,007","- The Lord Commander...
- We are sworn to protect.
"
2,2,188,"00:12:42,127","00:12:44,450","- Sam we can't take her.
- Please sir, please.
"
2,2,189,"00:12:44,570","00:12:46,206","I can still run if I have to.
"
2,2,190,"00:12:46,326","00:12:47,467","It's just not possible.
"
2,2,191,"00:12:47,587","00:12:50,038","I'm going to have a baby,
if it's a boy I...
"
2,2,192,"00:12:50,873","00:12:52,459","If it's a boy, what?
"
2,2,193,"00:12:58,002","00:13:01,667","You want us to risk our lives for you,
and you won't even tell us why.
"
2,2,194,"00:13:07,479","00:13:08,792","Why did you do that?
"
2,2,195,"00:13:08,912","00:13:10,415","Do what, ask her a question?
"
2,2,196,"00:13:10,535","00:13:11,924","- You were cruel.
- Cruel!?
"
2,2,197,"00:13:12,344","00:13:14,550","Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
"
2,2,198,"00:13:14,670","00:13:16,493","- I didn't touch her!
- No you just want to steal her,
"
2,2,199,"00:13:16,613","00:13:18,079","what do you think Craster
cuts off for that?
"
2,2,200,"00:13:18,199","00:13:19,626","I can't steal her,
"
2,2,201,"00:13:19,990","00:13:22,416","she's a person not a goat.
"
2,2,202,"00:13:27,000","00:13:29,791","We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.
"
2,2,203,"00:13:30,192","00:13:31,833","We can't take a girl with us.
"
2,2,204,"00:13:31,953","00:13:34,058","Mormont wouldn't have it.
And even if he would,
"
2,2,205,"00:13:34,368","00:13:35,645","what would we do with her?
"
2,2,206,"00:13:35,765","00:13:37,633","Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
"
2,2,207,"00:13:38,833","00:13:40,091","I could try...
"
2,2,208,"00:13:40,565","00:13:42,663","What? I've read about it.
"
2,2,209,"00:13:44,040","00:13:45,590","A bit.
"
2,2,210,"00:13:47,350","00:13:48,572","I'm sorry Sam,
"
2,2,211,"00:13:49,657","00:13:51,098","we can't help her.
"
2,2,212,"00:14:45,316","00:14:46,884","Khaleesi.
"
2,2,213,"00:15:30,684","00:15:33,437","- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.
"
2,2,214,"00:15:35,936","00:15:37,522","Who did this?
"
2,2,215,"00:15:37,805","00:15:39,373","Khal Pono perhaps,
"
2,2,216,"00:15:39,493","00:15:41,361","Khal Jhaqo...
"
2,2,217,"00:15:41,481","00:15:44,330","They don't like the idea of a
woman leading a Khalasaar.
"
2,2,218,"00:15:44,450","00:15:47,300","They will like it far less
when I'm done with them.
"
2,2,219,"00:17:16,139","00:17:18,191","Is it as you remember my lord?
"
2,2,220,"00:17:18,311","00:17:20,072","Looks smaller.
"
2,2,221,"00:17:20,192","00:17:22,095","Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.
"
2,2,222,"00:17:22,215","00:17:25,429","I remember my father's cabin, felt
like a palace when I was little.
"
2,2,223,"00:17:25,885","00:17:27,509","Now look at it...
"
2,2,224,"00:17:28,776","00:17:30,782","They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
"
2,2,225,"00:17:30,902","00:17:32,442","Who will?
"
2,2,226,"00:17:32,766","00:17:34,353","Anyone who matters,
"
2,2,227,"00:17:34,473","00:17:35,963","this is a big day for them.
"
2,2,228,"00:17:36,083","00:17:39,173","They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.
"
2,2,229,"00:17:39,835","00:17:42,050","It's a hard place the Iron Islands...
"
2,2,230,"00:17:42,170","00:17:43,728","always has been.
"
2,2,231,"00:17:43,848","00:17:45,807","It's cold and it's wet.
"
2,2,232,"00:17:46,213","00:17:47,398","I love the cold and wet.
"
2,2,233,"00:17:47,518","00:17:50,170","They say hard places breed hard men,
"
2,2,234,"00:17:50,449","00:17:53,786","and hard men rule the world.
"
2,2,235,"00:17:55,872","00:17:58,522","Then you'll be king before long.
"
2,2,236,"00:18:00,461","00:18:02,705","Try smiling with your lips closed.
"
2,2,237,"00:18:03,279","00:18:05,559","Hmm, better.
"
2,2,238,"00:18:08,268","00:18:10,907","My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
"
2,2,239,"00:18:11,027","00:18:12,591","I don't blame him.
"
2,2,240,"00:18:12,711","00:18:15,734","He says that you're all reavers and rapers.
"
2,2,241,"00:18:15,854","00:18:17,758","And that no matter how many women you have,
"
2,2,242,"00:18:17,878","00:18:19,450","you'll never be satis...
"
2,2,243,"00:18:19,570","00:18:22,275","Quit talking about your father.
"
2,2,244,"00:18:22,395","00:18:24,569","He's right about us.
"
2,2,245,"00:18:24,689","00:18:27,877","Our wives from the Iron Islands,
"
2,2,246,"00:18:28,216","00:18:31,608","they're for breeding.
That's not enough for us.
"
2,2,247,"00:18:31,728","00:18:35,698","That's why we take saltwives
from the women we capture.
"
2,2,248,"00:18:35,818","00:18:38,853","Capture me!
Take me with you when you go ashore.
"
2,2,249,"00:18:38,973","00:18:42,897","- Make me your saltwife.
- Your place is on this ship.
"
2,2,250,"00:18:43,017","00:18:44,801","Not after you leave.
"
2,2,251,"00:18:44,921","00:18:48,942","Father will punish me.
He'll call me a whore.
"
2,2,252,"00:18:49,867","00:18:51,326","I haven't paid you.
"
2,2,253,"00:19:29,543","00:19:30,801","I barely touched her.
"
2,2,254,"00:19:31,102","00:19:33,436","And you charge twice as much
as every other brothel.
"
2,2,255,"00:19:33,556","00:19:36,281","- And this is what I get, crying.
- One moment, my friend.
"
2,2,256,"00:19:36,401","00:19:37,336","A moment.
"
2,2,257,"00:19:46,181","00:19:48,510","Please accept my sincerest apologies.
"
2,2,258,"00:19:48,630","00:19:50,172","Ramka will take good care of you.
"
2,2,259,"00:20:18,970","00:20:22,379","- Sorry my lord.
- Shhh.
"
2,2,260,"00:20:24,756","00:20:25,937","Did he hurt you?
"
2,2,261,"00:20:28,093","00:20:29,428","Not, my lord.
"
2,2,262,"00:20:31,806","00:20:33,939","- It's Megan.
- Who?
"
2,2,263,"00:20:36,394","00:20:37,668","She works for you.
"
2,2,264,"00:20:38,666","00:20:44,083","She's the one, the girl whose,
they killed her baby.
"
2,2,265,"00:20:44,203","00:20:49,095","Ah, yes, that was
poorly handled.
"
2,2,266,"00:20:51,397","00:20:54,619","Sometimes those with the
most power have the least grace.
"
2,2,267,"00:20:56,138","00:20:58,486","Can't stop thinking about it,
"
2,2,268,"00:20:59,260","00:21:00,886","I can't sleep.
"
2,2,269,"00:21:02,759","00:21:04,585","Her poor little baby.
"
2,2,270,"00:21:05,882","00:21:07,953","You know you remind
me of another girl?
"
2,2,271,"00:21:09,106","00:21:12,058","A lovely thing I once acquired
from an Elysium pleasure house.
"
2,2,272,"00:21:13,527","00:21:16,288","Beautiful, like yourself,
"
2,2,273,"00:21:16,408","00:21:19,986","and intelligent as yourself.
"
2,2,274,"00:21:20,608","00:21:22,068","But she wasn't happy.
"
2,2,275,"00:21:23,721","00:21:28,501","She cried, often.
I asked her why but,
"
2,2,276,"00:21:30,423","00:21:33,219","we didn't have the kind of
rapport that you and I have.
"
2,2,277,"00:21:36,818","00:21:38,475","Yes, it was quite sad.
"
2,2,278,"00:21:40,899","00:21:43,553","Girls from Elysium pleasure
houses are expensive.
"
2,2,279,"00:21:44,090","00:21:45,624","Extremely expensive.
"
2,2,280,"00:21:46,269","00:21:48,862","And this one wasn't making me any money.
"
2,2,281,"00:21:53,142","00:21:55,305","I hate bad investments.
"
2,2,282,"00:21:56,310","00:21:58,474","Really, I do.
"
2,2,283,"00:21:58,594","00:22:00,591","They haunt me.
"
2,2,284,"00:22:04,612","00:22:06,753","I had no idea how to make her happy,
"
2,2,285,"00:22:07,880","00:22:10,182","no idea how to mitigate my losses.
"
2,2,286,"00:22:12,300","00:22:15,902","A very wealthy patron, he offered me
a tremendous amount of money
"
2,2,287,"00:22:16,022","00:22:21,073","to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.
"
2,2,288,"00:22:21,371","00:22:26,481","To use her in ways that
never occur to most men.
"
2,2,289,"00:22:28,238","00:22:30,501","And you know what occurs to most men.
"
2,2,290,"00:22:34,592","00:22:37,549","I wouldn't say he succeeded
in making her happy
"
2,2,291,"00:22:39,223","00:22:42,892","but my losses were definitely mitigated.
"
2,2,292,"00:22:50,813","00:22:53,038","Take tonight off.
Tomorrow, Megan's child
"
2,2,293,"00:22:54,610","00:22:55,922","will see you tomorrow.
"
2,2,294,"00:22:56,494","00:22:58,136","Better be happy.
"
2,2,295,"00:23:02,164","00:23:03,614","That makes me happy.
"
2,2,296,"00:23:15,920","00:23:17,191","More wine?
"
2,2,297,"00:23:17,959","00:23:20,475","- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.
"
2,2,298,"00:23:20,595","00:23:21,599","Leave us, Podrik.
"
2,2,299,"00:23:21,631","00:23:23,339","I believe we know
how to pour our own wine.
"
2,2,300,"00:23:24,913","00:23:28,103","Is that your new squire?
Could have found you a proper lad.
"
2,2,301,"00:23:28,223","00:23:30,977","Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
"
2,2,302,"00:23:31,223","00:23:32,812","Hmm, that's a good red.
"
2,2,303,"00:23:32,932","00:23:35,513","- Dornish?
- You know your wines, my lord.
"
2,2,304,"00:23:35,633","00:23:36,311","That I do.
"
2,2,305,"00:23:38,075","00:23:39,487","A fine dinner, my lord.
"
2,2,306,"00:23:39,607","00:23:40,890","Call me Tyrion, please.
"
2,2,307,"00:23:41,258","00:23:44,419","I'm sure you're getting used to
fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
"
2,2,308,"00:23:44,894","00:23:46,536","Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
"
2,2,309,"00:23:46,797","00:23:49,367","Wars have been started for less.
"
2,2,310,"00:23:50,594","00:23:51,768","I heard there was some trouble
"
2,2,311,"00:23:51,888","00:23:53,517","in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
"
2,2,312,"00:23:53,824","00:23:56,417","Hmm. Nasty business,
had to be done.
"
2,2,313,"00:23:56,537","00:23:57,430","Yes, of course.
"
2,2,314,"00:23:57,688","00:23:59,078","City Watch must keep the peace.
"
2,2,315,"00:23:59,198","00:24:03,574","Only, I hadn't realized peace
depended on killing babies.
"
2,2,316,"00:24:04,470","00:24:06,760","- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.
"
2,2,317,"00:24:06,911","00:24:08,690","Especially the queen's orders.
"
2,2,318,"00:24:08,761","00:24:10,500","I never said they were the queen's orders.
"
2,2,319,"00:24:10,580","00:24:14,422","No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?
"
2,2,320,"00:24:15,104","00:24:18,238","- She's always been a jealous woman.
- You know your sister better than I do.
"
2,2,321,"00:24:18,358","00:24:20,540","You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister.
"
2,2,322,"00:24:20,660","00:24:21,661","I don't listen to filth.
"
2,2,323,"00:24:21,781","00:24:24,974","That's good of you,
but you have heard them.
"
2,2,324,"00:24:25,387","00:24:27,262","I suppose people
who do believe that filth,
"
2,2,325,"00:24:27,382","00:24:29,095","consider Robert's bastards
to be better claimants
"
2,2,326,"00:24:29,215","00:24:30,721","to the throne than
Cersei's children.
"
2,2,327,"00:24:30,841","00:24:32,868","Joffrey is my king,
the rest doesn't interest me.
"
2,2,328,"00:24:32,988","00:24:34,403","I appreciate your loyalty.
"
2,2,329,"00:24:35,969","00:24:36,951","Tell me.
"
2,2,330,"00:24:37,703","00:24:40,874","When your men slaughtered
Ned Stark's men in the throne room,
"
2,2,331,"00:24:40,994","00:24:42,936","did you give the order?
"
2,2,332,"00:24:44,318","00:24:44,955","I did.
"
2,2,333,"00:24:45,075","00:24:46,811","And I would again.
"
2,2,334,"00:24:47,609","00:24:51,139","The man was a traitor.
He tried to buy my loyalty.
"
2,2,335,"00:24:51,259","00:24:52,228","The fool.
"
2,2,336,"00:24:53,216","00:24:55,134","He had no idea you
were already bought.
"
2,2,337,"00:24:55,825","00:24:56,914","Are you drunk?
"
2,2,338,"00:24:57,482","00:24:59,799","I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp.
"
2,2,339,"00:24:59,919","00:25:03,008","I'm not questioning
your honor, Lord Janos.
"
2,2,340,"00:25:03,465","00:25:05,455","I'm denying its existence.
"
2,2,341,"00:25:05,575","00:25:08,232","You think I'll stand here and
take this from you, dwarf.
"
2,2,342,"00:25:08,352","00:25:09,143","Dwarf?
"
2,2,343,"00:25:09,585","00:25:10,918","You should have stopped at imp.
"
2,2,344,"00:25:11,285","00:25:13,577","And yes, you will stand
here and take it from me,
"
2,2,345,"00:25:13,697","00:25:15,761","unless you'd like to take
it from my friend here.
"
2,2,346,"00:25:17,080","00:25:19,924","I intend to serve as Hand of the King
until my father returns from the war
"
2,2,347,"00:25:20,194","00:25:22,348","and seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,
"
2,2,348,"00:25:22,468","00:25:25,249","well I just wouldn't feel
safe with you lurking about.
"
2,2,349,"00:25:25,369","00:25:26,488","What are you
"
2,2,350,"00:25:26,761","00:25:28,565","My friends at court will not allow this.
"
2,2,351,"00:25:28,685","00:25:29,487","The queen herself...
"
2,2,352,"00:25:29,607","00:25:30,889","The queen regent.
"
2,2,353,"00:25:31,009","00:25:33,061","And you're a fool to
believe she's your friend.
"
2,2,354,"00:25:33,687","00:25:35,245","We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.
"
2,2,355,"00:25:35,365","00:25:36,400","No, we shan't.
"
2,2,356,"00:25:43,623","00:25:46,876","There's a ship leaving for
East Watch by the Sea tonight.
"
2,2,357,"00:25:47,217","00:25:50,277","From there, I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.
"
2,2,358,"00:25:50,766","00:25:52,017","I hope you enjoy the Wall.
"
2,2,359,"00:25:52,574","00:25:54,837","I found it surprisingly beautiful,
"
2,2,360,"00:25:55,395","00:25:58,818","in a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.
"
2,2,361,"00:25:59,117","00:26:00,277","The lads will escort you.
"
2,2,362,"00:26:00,641","00:26:02,393","The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
"
2,2,363,"00:26:02,718","00:26:04,402","These men are under my command.
"
2,2,364,"00:26:05,186","00:26:06,961","I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
"
2,2,365,"00:26:07,081","00:26:10,816","His name is Bronn and he is the
new commander of the City Watch.
"
2,2,366,"00:26:11,908","00:26:12,534","Boys.
"
2,2,367,"00:26:15,207","00:26:16,719","I have friends at court.
"
2,2,368,"00:26:17,197","00:26:18,266","Powerful friends.
"
2,2,369,"00:26:19,574","00:26:21,280","The king himself made me a lord.
"
2,2,370,"00:26:26,538","00:26:27,584","To the new Commander.
"
2,2,371,"00:26:34,558","00:26:40,257","If I told you to murder, an infant girl
say, still at her mother's breast,
"
2,2,372,"00:26:41,804","00:26:43,430","would you do it without question?
"
2,2,373,"00:26:45,867","00:26:47,402","Without question? No.
"
2,2,374,"00:26:48,528","00:26:49,609","I'd ask how much.
"
2,2,375,"00:27:07,234","00:27:08,975","If they come back, I say we yield.
"
2,2,376,"00:27:09,657","00:27:10,556","Gendry's the one they want.
"
2,2,377,"00:27:10,988","00:27:12,284","I don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.
"
2,2,378,"00:27:12,707","00:27:14,242","I'm not afraid of no battles.
"
2,2,379,"00:27:14,362","00:27:16,858","If you got within a mile of a
battle, you'd fill your pants.
"
2,2,380,"00:27:17,131","00:27:18,234","I've seen lots of battles.
"
2,2,381,"00:27:18,632","00:27:19,554","- I saw...
- Liar.
"
2,2,382,"00:27:20,139","00:27:24,404","I saw a man kill another man just
outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
"
2,2,383,"00:27:24,756","00:27:26,417","Stabbed him right in the neck.
"
2,2,384,"00:27:26,929","00:27:28,749","Two men fighting isn't a battle.
"
2,2,385,"00:27:29,397","00:27:30,694","They had armor on.
"
2,2,386,"00:27:31,450","00:27:32,041","So?
"
2,2,387,"00:27:32,667","00:27:34,657","So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.
"
2,2,388,"00:27:34,777","00:27:35,635","No, it isn't.
"
2,2,389,"00:27:36,648","00:27:38,866","What's a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?
"
2,2,390,"00:27:39,229","00:27:40,582","Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.
"
2,2,391,"00:27:41,424","00:27:44,006","Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
"
2,2,392,"00:27:45,969","00:27:48,365","It's when they've got armor on.
"
2,2,393,"00:27:48,485","00:27:49,386","I already told you that.
"
2,2,394,"00:27:51,124","00:27:52,043","A knight?
"
2,2,395,"00:27:53,217","00:27:54,086","How'd you know he was a knight?
"
2,2,396,"00:27:56,329","00:27:58,888","Well, cause they got armor on.
"
2,2,397,"00:27:59,519","00:28:01,116","You don't have to be a
knight to have armor.
"
2,2,398,"00:28:01,457","00:28:02,619","Any idiot can buy armor.
"
2,2,399,"00:28:03,171","00:28:03,875","How'd you know?
"
2,2,400,"00:28:04,967","00:28:06,188","Cause I sold armor.
"
2,2,401,"00:28:19,125","00:28:20,487","What do the gold-clips want with you?
"
2,2,402,"00:28:20,968","00:28:21,861","No idea.
"
2,2,403,"00:28:22,319","00:28:23,164","You're a liar.
"
2,2,404,"00:28:23,387","00:28:25,336","You shouldn't insult people
that are bigger than you.
"
2,2,405,"00:28:25,912","00:28:27,603","Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.
"
2,2,406,"00:28:28,232","00:28:29,442","No one gets to insult anyone.
"
2,2,407,"00:28:30,369","00:28:32,095","No good's ever come of those questions.
"
2,2,408,"00:28:32,215","00:28:33,387","No good's ever come?
"
2,2,409,"00:28:34,533","00:28:35,942","You've asked questions before?
"
2,2,410,"00:28:36,062","00:28:39,200","How can someone so small be
such a huge pain in my ass?
"
2,2,411,"00:28:39,587","00:28:40,585","Were you asked questions?
"
2,2,412,"00:28:43,259","00:28:46,125","The Hand of the King.
The Hands of the King.
"
2,2,413,"00:28:47,524","00:28:50,231","Lord Arryn came first, a
few weeks before he died.
"
2,2,414,"00:28:50,351","00:28:53,602","And then Lord Stark came, a
few weeks before he died.
"
2,2,415,"00:28:54,404","00:28:55,184","Lord Stark.
"
2,2,416,"00:28:56,216","00:28:59,633","See? Asking me questions is bad luck.
"
2,2,417,"00:29:01,405","00:29:02,849","You'll probably be dead soon.
"
2,2,418,"00:29:04,225","00:29:05,487","What did they ask about?
"
2,2,419,"00:29:05,877","00:29:08,229","- My mom.
- Who's your mom?
"
2,2,420,"00:29:08,575","00:29:10,045","Just my mom.
"
2,2,421,"00:29:10,165","00:29:11,908","Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
"
2,2,422,"00:29:12,252","00:29:13,170","And who was your father?
"
2,2,423,"00:29:13,592","00:29:16,160","He could be one of those gold-hatted
bastards, for all I know.
"
2,2,424,"00:29:16,643","00:29:17,762","What about you, anyway?
"
2,2,425,"00:29:18,954","00:29:20,092","I thought they were after you?
"
2,2,426,"00:29:21,633","00:29:22,294","Why?
"
2,2,427,"00:29:23,669","00:29:25,944","Did you kill someone?
Or is it just because you're a girl?
"
2,2,428,"00:29:26,627","00:29:27,526","I'm not a girl!
"
2,2,429,"00:29:27,838","00:29:28,571","Yes you are.
"
2,2,430,"00:29:29,287","00:29:30,791","You think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?
"
2,2,431,"00:29:30,977","00:29:33,936","Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls.
Everyone knows that.
"
2,2,432,"00:29:34,056","00:29:35,311","That's true. You're still a girl.
"
2,2,433,"00:29:35,393","00:29:36,172","I am not!
"
2,2,434,"00:29:36,210","00:29:38,028","Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss then.
"
2,2,435,"00:29:39,986","00:29:41,058","I don't need to take a piss.
"
2,2,436,"00:29:47,408","00:29:48,729","I'm in hot pike, aren't I now?
"
2,2,437,"00:29:49,874","00:29:50,622","No one can know.
"
2,2,438,"00:29:51,092","00:29:53,455","They won't. Not from me.
"
2,2,439,"00:29:57,286","00:29:58,372","My name's not Arry.
"
2,2,440,"00:30:00,029","00:30:02,891","It's Arya. Of House Stark.
"
2,2,441,"00:30:04,242","00:30:05,974","Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
"
2,2,442,"00:30:07,456","00:30:10,377","He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
"
2,2,443,"00:30:10,443","00:30:11,632","He was never a traitor.
"
2,2,444,"00:30:12,453","00:30:13,535","Joffrey is a liar.
"
2,2,445,"00:30:15,078","00:30:17,160","- So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
- No.
"
2,2,446,"00:30:17,543","00:30:18,317","I mean yes.
"
2,2,447,"00:30:18,726","00:30:20,366","My mother was a lady, and my sister.
"
2,2,448,"00:30:20,404","00:30:22,611","You were a lord's daughter
and you lived in a castle.
"
2,2,449,"00:30:24,005","00:30:25,560","Look, all that about cocks.
I should never have said that.
"
2,2,450,"00:30:26,720","00:30:28,398","I've been pissing in front
of you and everything.
"
2,2,451,"00:30:29,984","00:30:31,167","I should be calling you milady.
"
2,2,452,"00:30:31,201","00:30:32,548","Do not call me milady.
"
2,2,453,"00:30:32,596","00:30:33,538","As milady commands.
"
2,2,454,"00:30:34,613","00:30:35,527","Well, that was unladylike.
"
2,2,455,"00:31:03,952","00:31:04,991","What you carrying?
"
2,2,456,"00:31:07,142","00:31:08,247","Pears and oranges.
"
2,2,457,"00:31:08,899","00:31:09,869","Wine from the Arbor.
"
2,2,458,"00:31:11,516","00:31:13,524","And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands.
"
2,2,459,"00:31:17,094","00:31:19,903","The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
"
2,2,460,"00:31:23,667","00:31:24,383","Me.
"
2,2,461,"00:31:26,366","00:31:27,615","Don't like wine.

"
2,2,468,"00:32:02,184","00:32:03,304","You been at sea long?
"
2,2,469,"00:32:04,020","00:32:06,058","Or were there just no women
where you came from?
"
2,2,470,"00:32:06,436","00:32:07,244","None like you.
"
2,2,471,"00:32:07,593","00:32:08,713","You don't know what I'm like.

2,2,472,"00:32:09,172","00:32:10,328","You don't know what you're like.
"
2,2,473,"00:32:11,228","00:32:12,972","You need someone to teach you.
"
2,2,474,"00:32:14,404","00:32:15,543","Know who I am?
"
2,2,475,"00:32:16,241","00:32:18,958","You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry.
"
2,2,476,"00:32:20,188","00:32:21,565","Lord Greyjoy.
"
2,2,477,"00:32:24,406","00:32:25,985","Have my things sent up to the castle.
"
2,2,478,"00:32:43,250","00:32:46,078","You should give me the reins,
I'm a better rider than you.

2,2,479,"00:32:46,592","00:32:48,281","I've been on horseback
for the last nine years.
"
2,2,480,"00:32:48,777","00:32:51,862","Nine years. You still know
your way around a ship?
"
2,2,481,"00:32:52,592","00:32:54,373","Have these hands ever touched a rope?

don't watch where I'm going.
"
2,2,485,"00:33:04,086","00:33:05,702","I have a proposal for my father.

2,2,486,"00:33:06,969","00:33:09,080","One that will make him king again.
"
2,2,487,"00:33:09,581","00:33:10,866","And me after him.
"
2,2,488,"00:33:13,749","00:33:15,915","You may stay at the castle
tonight, if you're lucky.
"
2,2,489,"00:33:16,650","00:33:18,174","Is that an offer from my future king?
"
2,2,490,"00:33:18,225","00:33:20,061","An order. From your future king.
"
2,2,491,"00:33:22,742","00:33:24,716","You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.
"
2,2,492,"00:33:25,381","00:33:27,814","I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.
"
2,2,493,"00:33:40,662","00:33:41,764","Father.
"
2,2,494,"00:33:43,164","00:33:44,954","Nine years, is it?
"
2,2,495,"00:33:46,148","00:33:48,121","They took a frightened boy.
"
2,2,496,"00:33:48,856","00:33:50,141","What have they given back?
"
2,2,497,"00:33:51,908","00:33:53,171","A man.
"
2,2,498,"00:33:53,997","00:33:56,259","- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.
"
2,2,499,"00:33:58,382","00:34:00,420","Stark had you longer than I did.
"
2,2,500,"00:34:01,495","00:34:02,668","Lord Stark is gone.
"
2,2,501,"00:34:05,052","00:34:07,361","And how do you feel about that?
"
2,2,502,"00:34:11,149","00:34:12,007","What's done is done.
"
2,2,503,"00:34:13,671","00:34:15,245","I've brought you a
proposal from Robb Stark.
"
2,2,504,"00:34:15,269","00:34:16,712","Who gave you those clothes?
"
2,2,505,"00:34:18,182","00:34:21,356","Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?
"
2,2,506,"00:34:22,375","00:34:24,393","If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.
"
2,2,507,"00:34:24,433","00:34:25,292","It will.
"
2,2,508,"00:34:27,489","00:34:29,170","That bauble around your neck.
"
2,2,509,"00:34:29,561","00:34:32,498","Did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?
"
2,2,510,"00:34:33,603","00:34:35,001","I asked a question.
"
2,2,511,"00:34:35,284","00:34:37,810","Did you pull it from the
neck of a corpse you made
"
2,2,512,"00:34:38,049","00:34:41,762","or did you buy it to
match your fine clothes?
"
2,2,513,"00:34:44,062","00:34:46,059","Iron or gold?
"
2,2,514,"00:34:49,080","00:34:49,996","Gold.
"
2,2,515,"00:34:54,886","00:34:57,284","I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.
"
2,2,516,"00:35:00,856","00:35:02,337","My fears have come true.
"
2,2,517,"00:35:03,072","00:35:04,905","The Starks have made you theirs.
"
2,2,518,"00:35:05,025","00:35:06,633","My blood is salt and iron.
"
2,2,519,"00:35:06,668","00:35:10,227","Yet, the Stark boy sends you
to me like a trained raven,
"
2,2,520,"00:35:10,298","00:35:11,472","clutching his message.
"
2,2,521,"00:35:11,520","00:35:13,512","The offer he makes, is one I proposed.
"
2,2,522,"00:35:13,554","00:35:14,811","He heeds your counsel?
"
2,2,523,"00:35:14,931","00:35:17,463","I've lived with him, hunted
with him, fought at his side,
"
2,2,524,"00:35:17,487","00:35:18,775","he thinks of me as a brother.
"
2,2,525,"00:35:18,799","00:35:24,040","No, not here, not in my hearing,
you will not name him brother.
"
2,2,526,"00:35:24,059","00:35:27,885","This son of the man who put your
true brothers to the sword.
"
2,2,527,"00:35:28,005","00:35:30,367","Or have you forgotten your own blood?
"
2,2,528,"00:35:30,765","00:35:31,893","I forget nothing.
"
2,2,529,"00:35:32,504","00:35:33,886","I remember my brothers.
"
2,2,530,"00:35:35,474","00:35:37,542","And I remember when my father was a king.
"
2,2,531,"00:35:53,676","00:35:54,711","I see.
"
2,2,532,"00:35:55,519","00:35:57,981","I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him
"
2,2,533,"00:35:58,101","00:36:01,282","and he will make me King of
the Iron Islands once again.
"
2,2,534,"00:36:01,402","00:36:02,867","I will lead the attack myself.
"
2,2,535,"00:36:02,925","00:36:04,090","Oh, you will?
"
2,2,536,"00:36:05,184","00:36:07,202","I'm your son. Your only living heir.
"
2,2,537,"00:36:07,776","00:36:08,696","Who else?
"
2,2,538,"00:36:11,840","00:36:13,531","I told you to wait outside.
"
2,2,539,"00:36:15,322","00:36:16,773","How did you get past the guards?
"
2,2,540,"00:36:16,849","00:36:19,010","Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
"
2,2,541,"00:36:20,159","00:36:21,584","My dear.
"
2,2,542,"00:36:25,212","00:36:28,811","- Yara?
- So good to see you, brother.
"
2,2,543,"00:36:29,633","00:36:32,659","This is a homecoming I'll
tell my grandchildren about.
"
2,2,544,"00:36:35,647","00:36:36,909","She can't lead an attack.
"
2,2,545,"00:36:36,948","00:36:37,867","And why not?
"
2,2,546,"00:36:38,916","00:36:39,898","You're a woman.
"
2,2,547,"00:36:39,950","00:36:41,115","You're the one in skirts.
"
2,2,548,"00:36:41,235","00:36:42,732","This isn't Winterfell, boy.
"
2,2,549,"00:36:43,372","00:36:45,802","Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship
"
2,2,550,"00:36:45,922","00:36:48,491","after your new father killed him.
"
2,2,551,"00:36:48,611","00:36:51,034","What's dead may never die.
"
2,2,552,"00:36:52,298","00:36:55,823","The only night she's spent off these
islands has been spent on the sea.
"
2,2,553,"00:36:56,778","00:37:00,288","She's commanded men. She's killed men.
"
2,2,554,"00:37:00,877","00:37:02,933","She knows who she is.
"
2,2,555,"00:37:05,636","00:37:07,531","No man gives me a crown.
"
2,2,556,"00:37:08,339","00:37:10,307","I pay the iron price.
"
2,2,557,"00:37:11,144","00:37:12,863","I will take my crown.
"
2,2,558,"00:37:13,348","00:37:14,773","That is who I am.
"
2,2,559,"00:37:16,212","00:37:18,254","That is who we have always been.
"
2,2,560,"00:37:23,034","00:37:25,187","You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.
"
2,2,561,"00:37:25,205","00:37:27,208","Who said anything about the Lannisters?
"
2,2,562,"00:37:35,003","00:37:37,879","You'll have your gold when we take
the treasury at King's Landing.
"
2,2,563,"00:37:37,999","00:37:42,053","All these kings fighting for the throne
and this Stannis has the smallest army.
"
2,2,564,"00:37:42,721","00:37:44,516","Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?
"
2,2,565,"00:37:45,019","00:37:46,618","Because you're a smart gambler.
"
2,2,566,"00:37:47,718","00:37:49,664","Stannis has proved himself in war.
Twice.
"
2,2,567,"00:37:50,547","00:37:53,104","His baby brother has never
set foot on a battlefield.
"
2,2,568,"00:37:53,731","00:37:55,404","Neither has the false king, Joffrey.
"
2,2,569,"00:37:55,452","00:37:57,177","And yet, they both have larger armies.
"
2,2,570,"00:37:57,201","00:37:58,670","Stannis has just begun the fight.
"
2,2,571,"00:37:59,434","00:38:01,725","His bannermen will rally to his cause.
"
2,2,572,"00:38:02,802","00:38:06,856","There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.
"
2,2,573,"00:38:07,138","00:38:08,172","Or more worthy of loyalty.
"
2,2,574,"00:38:08,292","00:38:12,391","What is the world coming to when smugglers
must vouch for the honor of kings.
"
2,2,575,"00:38:12,406","00:38:14,169","- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.
"
2,2,576,"00:38:14,780","00:38:15,732","You think I'm insulted?
"
2,2,577,"00:38:16,307","00:38:19,081","I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.
"
2,2,578,"00:38:19,492","00:38:21,032","I don't sail for promises.
"
2,2,579,"00:38:21,152","00:38:21,998","Of course you do.
"
2,2,580,"00:38:22,880","00:38:24,948","Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise.
"
2,2,581,"00:38:25,782","00:38:27,112","A promise that somewhere on the seas,
"
2,2,582,"00:38:27,152","00:38:29,192","somebody's got some gold and
you can take it from them.
"
2,2,583,"00:38:29,221","00:38:30,603","That's a promise that always comes true.
"
2,2,584,"00:38:30,640","00:38:31,430","As is mine.
"
2,2,585,"00:38:32,325","00:38:33,876","You're not the young man, Salladhor.
"
2,2,586,"00:38:34,299","00:38:37,778","And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.
"
2,2,587,"00:38:38,567","00:38:39,883","Only the clever ones.
"
2,2,588,"00:38:40,513","00:38:42,685","You want to spend your
last few years on the sea,
"
2,2,589,"00:38:42,701","00:38:45,843","stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Midanese silk merchants,
"
2,2,590,"00:38:45,856","00:38:46,495","then go.
"
2,2,591,"00:38:46,523","00:38:47,303","They're out there waiting for you.
"
2,2,592,"00:38:47,999","00:38:48,808","That's easy.
"
2,2,593,"00:38:49,870","00:38:51,299","What I'm offering you is hard.
"
2,2,594,"00:38:53,736","00:38:56,349","Come with me and plunder the
greatest city in Westeros.
"
2,2,595,"00:38:57,468","00:38:59,781","You'll be the richest man in Lysene.
And the most famous.
"
2,2,596,"00:39:00,031","00:39:03,321","They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.
"
2,2,597,"00:39:05,483","00:39:07,335","Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
"
2,2,598,"00:39:07,455","00:39:08,167","It is.
"
2,2,599,"00:39:08,928","00:39:11,532","- One thing, I want the queen.
- The queen?
"
2,2,600,"00:39:11,652","00:39:13,422","Cersei, I want her.
"
2,2,601,"00:39:13,734","00:39:16,037","I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships,
"
2,2,602,"00:39:16,301","00:39:18,397","and if we don't drown at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay,
"
2,2,603,"00:39:18,517","00:39:21,514","I will fuck this blonde queen
and I will fuck her well.
"
2,2,604,"00:39:21,634","00:39:23,103","This war isn't about you.
"
2,2,605,"00:39:24,378","00:39:26,693","We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.
"
2,2,606,"00:39:27,152","00:39:29,573","I'm not going to rape her,
I'm going to fuck her.
"
2,2,607,"00:39:30,113","00:39:31,159","As if she would just let you.
"
2,2,608,"00:39:31,279","00:39:32,947","You don't know how persuasive I am.
"
2,2,609,"00:39:33,804","00:39:35,085","I never tried to fuck you.
"
2,2,610,"00:39:37,424","00:39:38,999","Stannis is the rightful king.
"
2,2,611,"00:39:39,119","00:39:40,526","And the Lord of Light.
"
2,2,612,"00:39:40,646","00:39:41,534","The one true god.
"
2,2,613,"00:39:41,554","00:39:43,146","I've been all over the world, my boy,
"
2,2,614,"00:39:43,151","00:39:45,834","and everywhere I go, people
tell me about the true god.
"
2,2,615,"00:39:46,099","00:39:47,717","They all think they found the right one.
"
2,2,616,"00:39:48,254","00:39:50,913","The one true god is what's
between a woman's legs,
"
2,2,617,"00:39:51,190","00:39:53,055","and better yet a queen's legs.
"
2,2,618,"00:39:54,999","00:39:56,930","I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.
"
2,2,619,"00:39:57,153","00:39:58,092","He's young yet.
"
2,2,620,"00:39:59,526","00:40:00,966","I promise you the gold.
"
2,2,621,"00:40:01,404","00:40:04,103","I promise you the glory.
I cannot promise you the queen.
"
2,2,622,"00:40:07,568","00:40:08,753","You believe your king can win?
"
2,2,623,"00:40:09,655","00:40:11,461","He is the one true king.
"
2,2,624,"00:40:11,835","00:40:13,330","You Westerosers are funny people.
"
2,2,625,"00:40:13,450","00:40:16,704","A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.
"
2,2,626,"00:40:18,506","00:40:20,530","I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.
"
2,2,627,"00:40:20,650","00:40:23,330","You are the most honest
smuggler I ever met.
"
2,2,628,"00:40:24,033","00:40:25,400","Make me rich.
"
2,2,629,"00:40:26,521","00:40:29,148","Get me to the gates of
King's Landing and I will.
"
2,2,630,"00:40:40,846","00:40:42,433","When will the King have a sail?
"
2,2,631,"00:40:42,852","00:40:44,366","As soon as his God wills it.
"
2,2,632,"00:40:44,486","00:40:46,636","He's my God too, and yours...
"
2,2,633,"00:40:47,148","00:40:48,880","but you were too blind to see.
"
2,2,634,"00:40:51,480","00:40:53,754","- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh you and your mother.
"
2,2,635,"00:40:53,874","00:40:55,213","It won't take long you
already know the letters.
"
2,2,636,"00:40:55,333","00:40:57,602","The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.
"
2,2,637,"00:40:57,722","00:40:59,166","I wish I had a God, truly!
"
2,2,638,"00:40:59,286","00:41:00,698","I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men
"
2,2,639,"00:41:00,818","00:41:04,314","pray to every God there is. Pray for wind,
pray for rain, pray for home,
"
2,2,640,"00:41:04,434","00:41:06,761","- None of it works!
- But you always came home.
"
2,2,641,"00:41:06,881","00:41:08,508","I wasn't praying, you know.
"
2,2,642,"00:41:09,091","00:41:10,641","But I was.
"
2,2,643,"00:41:11,909","00:41:13,568","Every night that you're at sea,
"
2,2,644,"00:41:13,688","00:41:16,240","I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
"
2,2,645,"00:41:17,754","00:41:20,134","You want me to have a god, fine.
"
2,2,646,"00:41:20,481","00:41:21,921","King Stannis is my god.
"
2,2,647,"00:41:22,259","00:41:24,374","He raised me up and blessed
me with his trust.
"
2,2,648,"00:41:24,647","00:41:25,906","He gave you a future
"
2,2,649,"00:41:26,026","00:41:27,438","I could never have imagined.
"
2,2,650,"00:41:27,558","00:41:29,333","You know how to read,
you'll be a knight someday.
"
2,2,651,"00:41:29,453","00:41:32,185","You think your fire god commanded all that?
"
2,2,652,"00:41:32,305","00:41:33,603","It was Stannis.
"

"
2,2,654,"00:41:36,001","00:41:38,718","Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
"
2,2,655,"00:41:38,838","00:41:40,579","Don't tell him that.
"
2,2,656,"00:41:43,004","00:41:45,146","Lord Janos Slynt was
Commander of the City Watch.
"
2,2,657,"00:41:45,266","00:41:46,660","You had no right to exile him.
"
2,2,658,"00:41:46,780","00:41:48,453","I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
"
2,2,659,"00:41:48,573","00:41:50,891","You're serving as the King's
Hand until father gets here.
"
2,2,660,"00:41:51,011","00:41:53,541","- I am Queen Regent.
- Listen to me, Queen Regent,
"
2,2,661,"00:41:53,661","00:41:55,164","you're losing the people.
"
2,2,662,"00:41:56,145","00:41:58,224","- Do you hear me?
- The people?
"
2,2,663,"00:41:58,607","00:41:59,974","You think I care?
"
2,2,664,"00:42:00,094","00:42:03,375","You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.
"
2,2,665,"00:42:04,397","00:42:08,271","Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.
"
2,2,666,"00:42:08,650","00:42:12,006","And gold-plated foes
just gave them the rallying cry.
"
2,2,667,"00:42:12,444","00:42:14,650","The Queen slaughters babies.
"
2,2,668,"00:42:17,158","00:42:19,547","You don't even have the decency to deny it.
"
2,2,669,"00:42:29,460","00:42:32,187","It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?
"
2,2,670,"00:42:32,811","00:42:34,707","Joffrey didn't even tell you.
"
2,2,671,"00:42:36,841","00:42:38,337","Did he tell you?
"
2,2,672,"00:42:38,993","00:42:40,671","I imagine that would be even worse.
"
2,2,673,"00:42:40,791","00:42:42,385","He did what needed to be done.
"
2,2,674,"00:42:43,255","00:42:44,749","You want to be the Hand of the King?
"
2,2,675,"00:42:44,869","00:42:45,916","You want to rule?
"
2,2,676,"00:42:46,036","00:42:47,307","This is what ruling is!
"
2,2,677,"00:42:47,427","00:42:48,871","Lying on a bed of weeds,
"
2,2,678,"00:42:48,991","00:42:52,599","ripping them out by the root one by one
before they strangle you in your sleep.
"
2,2,679,"00:42:52,719","00:42:54,935","I'm no king, but I think there's
more to ruling that that.
"
2,2,680,"00:42:55,055","00:42:56,521","I don't care what you think!
"
2,2,681,"00:42:57,101","00:42:58,496","You've never taken it seriously.
"
2,2,682,"00:42:58,616","00:43:00,411","You haven't, Jaime hasn't.
"
2,2,683,"00:43:03,601","00:43:05,966","It's all fallen on me.
"
2,2,684,"00:43:09,849","00:43:13,264","As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.
"
2,2,685,"00:43:18,144","00:43:20,460","You're funny.
"
2,2,686,"00:43:22,742","00:43:25,494","You've always been funny.
"
2,2,687,"00:43:26,501","00:43:30,025","But none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?
"
2,2,688,"00:43:31,233","00:43:32,844","You remember...
"
2,2,689,"00:43:34,019","00:43:38,113","Back when you ripped my mother open on
your way out of her and she bled to death.
"
2,2,690,"00:43:40,016","00:43:41,661","She was my mother too.
"
2,2,691,"00:43:42,298","00:43:43,468","Now they're gone,
"
2,2,692,"00:43:45,971","00:43:47,475","for the sake of you.
"
2,2,693,"00:43:50,576","00:43:52,653","There's no bigger joke
in the world than that.
"
2,2,694,"00:44:14,127","00:44:17,027","Your Grace.
Your Grace.
"
2,2,695,"00:44:17,147","00:44:19,255","How did it fare with your pirate?
"
2,2,696,"00:44:19,375","00:44:21,403","Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.
"
2,2,697,"00:44:21,523","00:44:24,142","30 ships, his men know how to fight.
"
2,2,698,"00:44:24,652","00:44:27,686","In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.
"
2,2,699,"00:44:28,277","00:44:31,633","- Does seem the wiser choice.
- It won't be a choice this time.
"
2,2,700,"00:44:32,847","00:44:34,136","Do you trust him?
"
2,2,701,"00:44:34,941","00:44:37,787","Salladhor Saan is an old friend,
I've known him 30 years.
"
2,2,702,"00:44:38,244","00:44:39,908","I've never trusted him.
"
2,2,703,"00:44:40,660","00:44:43,184","Now once he gets the smell
of gold, he never stops.
"
2,2,704,"00:44:44,311","00:44:46,728","Well if he does his job,
he'll have his share.
"
2,2,705,"00:44:50,943","00:44:52,313","Leave us.
"
2,2,706,"00:44:58,444","00:44:59,976","At once, Your Grace.
"
2,2,707,"00:45:06,374","00:45:09,041","The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.
"
2,2,708,"00:45:14,602","00:45:16,016","Come.
"
2,2,709,"00:45:23,083","00:45:24,245","What did you say to him?
"
2,2,710,"00:45:24,365","00:45:27,915","I told him death by fire
is the purest death.
"
2,2,711,"00:45:28,219","00:45:30,754","- Why?
- Because it is true.
"
2,2,712,"00:45:32,107","00:45:33,803","You're troubled my king.
"
2,2,713,"00:45:34,241","00:45:35,189","Yeah.
"
2,2,714,"00:45:35,463","00:45:38,362","These armies are but toys
for the Lord of Light.
"
2,2,715,"00:45:38,482","00:45:40,077","Tell your lord to burn them then.
"
2,2,716,"00:45:40,697","00:45:42,456","I tell him nothing!
"
2,2,717,"00:45:42,576","00:45:45,570","I pray for his commands and I obey.
"
2,2,718,"00:45:47,319","00:45:50,355","My little brother has a hundred
thousand men according to the scouts.
"
2,2,719,"00:45:51,085","00:45:53,510","Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
"
2,2,720,"00:45:53,865","00:45:56,674","- You must have faith.
- Faith?
"
2,2,721,"00:45:58,606","00:46:02,930","In a real war, the side with the greater
number wins nine times out of ten.
"
2,2,722,"00:46:03,376","00:46:04,817","Then we must be the ten.
"
2,2,723,"00:46:04,937","00:46:07,670","I cannot defeat my brother in the field,
"
2,2,724,"00:46:09,002","00:46:11,446","and I can't take King's Landing
without the men he stole.
"
2,2,725,"00:46:13,981","00:46:16,907","I have seen the path to
victory in the flames.
"
2,2,726,"00:46:18,873","00:46:21,963","At first, you must give
yourself to the Lord of Light.
"
2,2,727,"00:46:22,083","00:46:24,845","I've said the words, damn you.
"
2,2,728,"00:46:27,950","00:46:29,801","I burnt the idols.
"
2,2,729,"00:46:33,430","00:46:36,530","You must give all of yourself.
"
2,2,730,"00:46:41,423","00:46:43,289","I have a wife.
"
2,2,731,"00:46:44,767","00:46:46,335","I took a vow.
"
2,2,732,"00:46:47,849","00:46:49,527","She's sick.
"
2,2,733,"00:46:50,585","00:46:52,135","Weak.
"
2,2,734,"00:46:52,691","00:46:54,953","Shut away in the tower.

2,2,735,"00:46:56,302","00:46:57,706","She disgusts you.
"
2,2,736,"00:47:01,199","00:47:03,268","And she's giving you nothing.

for sewing.

in her chamber while she sewed

"
2,3,76,"00:07:31,256","00:07:33,524","These are dreams, Bran,
"
2,3,77,"00:07:33,559","00:07:35,059","nothing more.
"
2,3,78,"00:07:35,094","00:07:37,795","No, my dreams
are different.

"
2,3,80,"00:07:40,065","00:07:42,600","I dreamt of my father dying.
"
2,3,81,"00:07:42,634","00:07:45,303","And Rickon had
the same dream.
"
2,3,82,"00:07:45,337","00:07:48,206","What about all the dreams
you had that didn't come true?
"
2,3,83,"00:07:50,009","00:07:52,277","Hmm?
"
2,3,84,"00:07:55,715","00:07:57,650","Right.
"
2,3,85,"00:07:57,684","00:08:01,721","This link is made
of Valyrian steel.

2,3,87,"00:08:05,726","00:08:09,695","It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

2,3,89,"00:08:13,933","00:08:15,835","I was no different.
"
2,3,90,"00:08:15,869","00:08:17,937","I was young.
"
2,3,91,"00:08:17,971","00:08:22,541","And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers
"
2,3,92,"00:08:22,576","00:08:26,679","to lift him out of his
dull life into a special one?

for all my efforts,
"
2,3,94,"00:08:29,582","00:08:32,818","I got no more out of it

"
2,3,96,"00:08:44,162","00:08:46,697","All right.
"
2,3,97,"00:08:46,731","00:08:50,901","Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.
"
2,3,98,"00:08:52,636","00:08:54,771","But not anymore.

bested once or twice,

in that fashion.
"
2,3,111,"00:10:52,791","00:10:56,828","Now, now, my love. My brother
fought valiantly for you.

"
2,3,120,"00:11:19,485","00:11:22,654","I will be one of your seven,

"
2,3,139,"00:12:34,725","00:12:37,094","And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

Lady Stark is an honored guest.

my son's war councils.

he should come himself,

his mother's skirts.

"
2,3,149,"00:13:16,133","00:13:18,201","Our war is just beginning.

- Gerard.

2,3,157,"00:13:51,834","00:13:54,403","It's a game to you,
isn't it?
"
2,3,158,"00:13:54,437","00:13:56,705","- I pity them.
- Why?
"
2,3,159,"00:13:56,740","00:13:58,607","Because it won't last.
"
2,3,160,"00:13:58,642","00:14:02,912","Because they are the Knights of summer
and winter is coming.
"

Lady Catelyn to her tent.

My Lady.

2,3,166,"00:14:23,502","00:14:26,204","You fought bravely today,
Lady Brienne.
"
2,3,167,"00:14:26,238","00:14:28,606","I fought for my King.

if I must.
"
2,3,170,"00:14:34,045","00:14:38,215","And, if it please you,
Brienne's enough.

you didn't recognize me.
"
2,3,176,"00:15:23,197","00:15:26,432","Recognize you?
How could I?
"
2,3,177,"00:15:26,466","00:15:28,334","The last time I saw you...
"
2,3,178,"00:15:29,736","00:15:31,871","You looked like
a fat little boy.
"
2,3,179,"00:15:32,907","00:15:35,541","You were a fat
little boy, too,
"
2,3,180,"00:15:35,575","00:15:38,111","but I recognized you.
"
2,3,181,"00:15:38,146","00:15:39,579","Why didn't you tell me?
"
2,3,182,"00:15:39,614","00:15:41,649","I wanted to see
who you were first.
"
2,3,183,"00:15:41,683","00:15:43,684","And I did.
"
2,3,184,"00:15:45,888","00:15:48,957","The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

2,3,185,"00:15:48,991","00:15:51,859","- Father.
- Father.
"
2,3,186,"00:15:53,295","00:15:55,696","The wolf pup
has gone south

fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

2,3,236,"00:18:26,590","00:18:28,959","Your last boy!
"
2,3,237,"00:18:28,993","00:18:32,762","You gave me away like I was some dog
you didn't want anymore.
"
2,3,238,"00:18:32,797","00:18:36,166","And now you curse me
because I've come home.
"
2,3,239,"00:18:46,077","00:18:49,479","You'd have our father bow
down to your other family?
"
2,3,240,"00:18:49,514","00:18:52,081","I have no other family.
"
2,3,241,"00:18:52,116","00:18:54,150","Don't you?
"
2,3,242,"00:18:55,385","00:18:57,687","Make your choice, Theon,
and do it quickly.
"
2,3,243,"00:18:57,722","00:19:00,490","Our ships sail
with or without you.
"
2,3,244,"00:19:12,636","00:19:14,303","You won't let me
leave this room.
"
2,3,245,"00:19:14,338","00:19:17,340","- You won't let me--
- Shh, shh, keep your voice down.
"
2,3,246,"00:19:20,010","00:19:23,446","Why? You think your father
can hear me?
"
2,3,247,"00:19:23,480","00:19:26,115","He's 300 miles away!
"
2,3,248,"00:19:28,152","00:19:31,153","I don't intend for you
to stay here.
"
2,3,249,"00:19:31,188","00:19:34,090","I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.
"
2,3,250,"00:19:34,124","00:19:37,793","Again, only temporary.
"
2,3,251,"00:19:37,827","00:19:40,362","Every man who has
tasted my cooking
"
2,3,252,"00:19:40,397","00:19:42,398","has told me what
a good whore I am.
"
2,3,253,"00:19:42,432","00:19:44,400","But you wouldn't
be a cook.
"
2,3,254,"00:19:44,434","00:19:48,137","You'd pose
as a scullion.
"
2,3,255,"00:19:48,172","00:19:51,374","Scullion?
What is a scullion?
"
2,3,256,"00:19:51,409","00:19:54,077","Kitchen wench.
"
2,3,257,"00:19:54,111","00:19:56,780","- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but--
"
2,3,258,"00:19:56,814","00:19:58,308","Cleaning pots?
"
2,3,259,"00:19:58,333","00:20:00,901","Is that how my lion
wants to see me?
"
2,3,260,"00:20:00,985","00:20:03,720","Your lion wants
to see you alive.
"
2,3,261,"00:20:03,754","00:20:06,189","We've come to
a dangerous place.
"
2,3,262,"00:20:06,223","00:20:08,024","My sister wants to hurt me.
"
2,3,263,"00:20:08,059","00:20:10,226","She'll look for any
weakness she can find.
"
2,3,264,"00:20:10,260","00:20:12,128","She can't know about you.
"
2,3,265,"00:20:12,162","00:20:14,263","I'm the weakness?
"
2,3,266,"00:20:14,298","00:20:15,764","It's a compliment,
My Lady.
"
2,3,267,"00:20:15,799","00:20:19,467","How is being a weakness
a compliment?
"
2,3,268,"00:20:22,538","00:20:24,239","Language can be
a bit tricky here.
"
2,3,269,"00:20:24,273","00:20:28,109","Oh, I'm too stupid
to understand.
"
2,3,270,"00:20:28,143","00:20:30,511","The stupid foreign girl.
"
2,3,271,"00:20:32,948","00:20:36,250","I am not
a kitchen wench.
"
2,3,272,"00:21:00,974","00:21:03,476","When will Joffrey
and Sansa be married?
"
2,3,273,"00:21:03,510","00:21:06,044","Soon, darling,
when the war is over.
"
2,3,274,"00:21:06,079","00:21:08,980","Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony
"
2,3,275,"00:21:09,015","00:21:11,450","and another for the feast.
"
2,3,276,"00:21:11,484","00:21:14,553","But yours will be ivory
since you're the bride.
"
2,3,277,"00:21:18,692","00:21:20,894","The Princess
just spoke to you.
"
2,3,278,"00:21:20,928","00:21:22,997","Pardon, Your Grace.
"
2,3,279,"00:21:25,367","00:21:27,668","I'm sure your dress will
be beautiful, Myrcella.
"
2,3,280,"00:21:27,702","00:21:31,238","I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done
"
2,3,281,"00:21:31,273","00:21:35,342","and I can pledge my love to
the King in sight of the Gods.
"
2,3,282,"00:21:39,546","00:21:41,814","Is Joffrey going to kill
Sansa's brother?
"
2,3,283,"00:21:44,351","00:21:46,418","He might.
"
2,3,284,"00:21:48,054","00:21:50,488","Would you like that?
"
2,3,285,"00:21:52,024","00:21:54,659","No.
I don't think so.
"
2,3,286,"00:21:55,895","00:21:59,564","Even if he does,
Sansa will do her duty.
"
2,3,287,"00:22:01,334","00:22:03,335","Won't you, little dove?
"
2,3,288,"00:22:19,919","00:22:22,954","Come in.
"
2,3,289,"00:22:26,759","00:22:28,126","Who are you?
"
2,3,290,"00:22:28,160","00:22:31,062","I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.
"
2,3,291,"00:22:31,097","00:22:34,499","I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.
"
2,3,292,"00:22:36,102","00:22:38,904","- You're not from here.
- No.
"
2,3,293,"00:22:45,013","00:22:46,547","What are you doing?
"
2,3,294,"00:22:46,581","00:22:48,449","Waiting for you
to tell me what to do.
"
2,3,295,"00:22:48,484","00:22:50,718","I shouldn't have to tell
you to do things.
"
2,3,296,"00:22:50,753","00:22:52,988","You should just do them.
"
2,3,297,"00:22:53,022","00:22:55,190","What things?
"
2,3,298,"00:22:55,224","00:22:57,292","Change my linens,
wash my clothing,
"
2,3,299,"00:22:57,326","00:23:00,929","scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot,
brush my hair.
"
2,3,300,"00:23:09,772","00:23:11,606","- No.
- You said to brush--
"
2,3,301,"00:23:11,641","00:23:14,442","Not now.
"
2,3,302,"00:23:16,012","00:23:18,880","Your chamber pot
is empty.
"
2,3,303,"00:23:18,914","00:23:21,183","Clean the table.
"
2,3,304,"00:23:25,788","00:23:28,590","Have you ever been
a handmaiden before?
"
2,3,305,"00:23:28,624","00:23:30,659","- Yes.
- For whom?
"
2,3,306,"00:23:30,694","00:23:32,694","- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?
"
2,3,307,"00:23:34,698","00:23:36,598","Lady Zuriff.
"
2,3,308,"00:23:36,633","00:23:40,336","There is no Lady Zuriff
in this city.
"
2,3,309,"00:23:40,370","00:23:42,271","She wasn't in
this city.
"
2,3,310,"00:23:42,305","00:23:44,707","Well, I don't know how
they did things in that city,
"
2,3,311,"00:23:44,741","00:23:47,676","but in this city,
handmaidens wait on ladies,
"
2,3,312,"00:23:47,710","00:23:49,245","not the other way around.
"
2,3,313,"00:23:49,279","00:23:52,181","And I don't have time
to answer 1,000 questions
"
2,3,314,"00:23:52,215","00:23:54,683","and teach you
how to do your job.
"
2,3,315,"00:23:57,854","00:23:59,521","Do you want me to leave?
"
2,3,316,"00:24:07,430","00:24:09,465","Just brush my hair.
"
2,3,317,"00:24:23,749","00:24:26,351","Oh, thank the Gods.
"
2,3,318,"00:24:26,385","00:24:28,620","I haven't had
a proper shit in six days.
"
2,3,319,"00:24:28,654","00:24:32,157","I've encountered this
problem before, My Lord.
"
2,3,320,"00:24:32,191","00:24:35,694","The stresses of power
often have this
"
2,3,321,"00:24:35,728","00:24:37,529","insalubrious effect.
"
2,3,322,"00:24:37,564","00:24:40,698","Two drops
with water daily.
"
2,3,323,"00:24:40,733","00:24:42,600","Right. I'm so grateful
to have a man
"
2,3,324,"00:24:42,635","00:24:45,336","of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.
"
2,3,325,"00:24:45,371","00:24:48,239","- Please.
- Thank you, My Lord.
"
2,3,326,"00:24:53,045","00:24:55,147","I can trust you,
Pycelle, can I not?
"
2,3,327,"00:24:55,181","00:24:56,982","Why, yes, of course,
My Lord.
"
2,3,328,"00:24:57,017","00:24:59,185","These are perilous times.
"
2,3,329,"00:24:59,220","00:25:01,187","And the crown must forge
new alliances.
"
2,3,330,"00:25:02,590","00:25:06,327","And these alliances must often
be sealed in matrimony.
"
2,3,331,"00:25:06,361","00:25:08,863","Matrimony, huh?
"
2,3,332,"00:25:08,897","00:25:10,799","Yes.
"
2,3,333,"00:25:10,833","00:25:13,034","I'm trusting the council
with these plans,
"
2,3,334,"00:25:13,069","00:25:14,803","but the queen mustn't know.
"
2,3,335,"00:25:14,837","00:25:17,405","We can't have her
meddling in affairs
"
2,3,336,"00:25:17,440","00:25:18,785","that could determine
the future of the realm.
"
2,3,337,"00:25:18,810","00:25:20,010","There's too much at stake.
"
2,3,338,"00:25:20,176","00:25:23,144","Oh, yes, yes.
Indeed, yes.
"
2,3,339,"00:25:23,179","00:25:26,447","I shall be silent
as the grave.
"
2,3,340,"00:25:26,482","00:25:30,551","I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.
"
2,3,341,"00:25:30,586","00:25:33,054","Princess Myrcella will wed
their youngest son
"
2,3,342,"00:25:33,088","00:25:36,024","when she comes of age,
ensuring their loyalty
"
2,3,343,"00:25:36,059","00:25:38,728","and their army
should we need it.
"
2,3,344,"00:25:38,762","00:25:42,733","Myrcella sent away
to Dorne?
"
2,3,345,"00:25:44,436","00:25:47,806","But remember,
the queen mustn't know.
"
2,3,346,"00:25:47,840","00:25:51,109","Ooh, ""the queen
mustn't know.""
"
2,3,347,"00:25:51,144","00:25:54,679","I love conversations
that begin this way.
"
2,3,348,"00:25:54,714","00:25:57,949","I plan to marry
Princess Myrcella off
"
2,3,349,"00:25:57,984","00:25:59,684","to Theon Greyjoy.

of Winterfell.
"
2,3,353,"00:26:09,162","00:26:10,795","He fights
for Robb Stark.
"
2,3,354,"00:26:10,829","00:26:14,365","Precisely. Theon's father
loathes the Starks
"
2,3,355,"00:26:14,399","00:26:17,168","and will convince the boy
to come to our side.
"
2,3,356,"00:26:17,236","00:26:20,671","Greyjoy can destroy
the northern army from within

"
2,3,362,"00:26:38,257","00:26:40,592","But perhaps the promise
of a royal match
"
2,3,363,"00:26:40,626","00:26:43,861","will convince her
to let bygones be bygones.
"
2,3,364,"00:26:43,895","00:26:45,830","She imprisoned you.
"
2,3,365,"00:26:45,864","00:26:47,932","She tried
to execute you.

2,3,366,"00:26:47,966","00:26:50,901","And you offer
her son a princess?
"
2,3,367,"00:26:50,936","00:26:54,771","For men in our position,
holding grudges can be
"
2,3,368,"00:26:54,806","00:26:56,573","an encumbrance,
don't you think?

this war,
"

"
2,3,397,"00:29:09,544","00:29:12,413","A member of the Kingsguard?
"
2,3,398,"00:29:12,447","00:29:15,283","As if I wasn't humiliated
enough already.
"
2,3,399,"00:29:17,586","00:29:21,823","Brienne is a very
capable warrior.

us apart.

2,4,227,"00:17:22,727","00:17:25,829","Or simply prefers
solitude?

2,4,228,"00:17:25,863","00:17:28,733","Pressures of command,

2,4,512,"00:38:35,752","00:38:38,420","We weren't expecting you

2,4,513,"00:38:38,454","00:38:41,090","Evidently not.
"
2,4,514,"00:38:43,126","00:38:44,927","Why are these prisoners

that we can afford to discard
"
2,4,520,"00:38:58,844","00:39:01,646","able young bodies

in everything.

punishment

with the cleaver.

head out on your own.
"
2,5,297,"00:18:59,090","00:19:01,530","And I will hunt you down,
drag you back here in chains,
"
2,5,298,"00:19:01,555","00:19:03,093","and hang you for a traitor.
"
2,5,299,"00:19:03,094","00:19:05,696","Stop. We yield.
"
2,5,300,"00:19:08,433","00:19:11,902","Congratulations
on your first command.
"
2,5,301,"00:19:11,937","00:19:14,672","Thank you. Kind of you
to come see me off.
"
2,5,302,"00:19:14,706","00:19:16,173","Oh, I'm not here
for you.
"
2,5,303,"00:19:16,208","00:19:19,209","I was just on my way
to Red Harbor.
"
2,5,304,"00:19:19,244","00:19:23,014","I've got 30 ships. There's
nowhere to put them here.
"
2,5,305,"00:19:23,048","00:19:26,316","- Too narrow.
- You'd better get out there.
"
2,5,306,"00:19:26,351","00:19:28,385","Wouldn't want them
to set sail without you.
"
2,5,307,"00:19:28,419","00:19:30,287","That would never happen.
"
2,5,308,"00:19:30,322","00:19:34,324","My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.
"
2,5,309,"00:19:34,359","00:19:36,860","This lot, though...
"
2,5,310,"00:19:38,363","00:19:41,098","Enjoy the Stony Shore.
"
2,5,311,"00:19:45,470","00:19:48,071","Come on,
I'll take you out.
"
2,5,312,"00:19:48,106","00:19:49,907","Who are you?
"
2,5,313,"00:19:49,941","00:19:52,009","Dagmer, your first mate.
"
2,5,314,"00:19:53,211","00:19:55,313","Why aren't you with
the rest of them?
"
2,5,315,"00:19:55,347","00:19:59,417","Or did they send you to row me
out and dump me halfway in the sea?
"
2,5,316,"00:19:59,451","00:20:00,852","That would be good
for a laugh.
"
2,5,317,"00:20:00,886","00:20:03,755","They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.
"
2,5,318,"00:20:03,790","00:20:05,616","And how am I supposed
to prove myself by pillaging
"
2,5,319,"00:20:05,641","00:20:07,226","piss-poor fishing villages?
"
2,5,320,"00:20:07,227","00:20:09,294","You're not.
"
2,5,321,"00:20:09,329","00:20:11,497","And yet that's the task
my father has given me
"
2,5,322,"00:20:11,531","00:20:14,900","to prove that
I'm a true Iron Islander.
"
2,5,323,"00:20:14,934","00:20:17,202","<i>They're all Iron Islanders.</i>
"
2,5,324,"00:20:17,237","00:20:20,706","Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?
"
2,5,325,"00:20:27,747","00:20:30,715","The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.
"
2,5,326,"00:20:30,749","00:20:33,385","The seat of the House
of Tallhart--
"
2,5,327,"00:20:33,419","00:20:36,321","a more impressive prize than
a few fishermen's daughters.
"
2,5,328,"00:20:37,924","00:20:39,615","What, you don't think
we could take it?
"
2,5,329,"00:20:39,640","00:20:40,793","No, we could.
"
2,5,330,"00:20:40,794","00:20:42,996","We could never hold it
for more than a few days.
"
2,5,331,"00:20:43,030","00:20:45,398","As soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,
"
2,5,332,"00:20:45,433","00:20:48,235","the Starks would send
their men to take it back.
"
2,5,333,"00:20:49,771","00:20:52,406","And then--
"
2,5,334,"00:20:57,345","00:20:59,780","take me to my ship.
"
2,5,335,"00:21:03,918","00:21:06,920","The Starks have
overextended their lines.
"
2,5,336,"00:21:06,955","00:21:09,022","Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time
"
2,5,337,"00:21:09,057","00:21:11,124","keeping their men
and horses fed.
"
2,5,338,"00:21:11,159","00:21:13,260","The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.
"
2,5,339,"00:21:13,295","00:21:14,996","The cold won't beat them.
"
2,5,340,"00:21:15,030","00:21:19,634","Our spies report growing
discontent among the northern lords.
"
2,5,341,"00:21:19,669","00:21:21,168","They want to return home
"
2,5,342,"00:21:21,193","00:21:23,837","and gather the harvest
before the crops turn.
"
2,5,343,"00:21:24,341","00:21:27,277","And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,
"
2,5,344,"00:21:27,311","00:21:30,481","they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.
"
2,5,345,"00:21:30,515","00:21:33,383","This is war;
No one's content.
"
2,5,346,"00:21:35,120","00:21:38,355","We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.
"
2,5,347,"00:21:38,390","00:21:41,725","He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.
"
2,5,348,"00:21:41,760","00:21:43,861","And as long as he keeps
winning battles,
"
2,5,349,"00:21:43,895","00:21:47,798","they'll keep believing
he is King in the North.
"
2,5,350,"00:21:47,832","00:21:49,467","You've been waiting
for him to fail.
"
2,5,351,"00:21:49,501","00:21:52,036","He is not going to fail,
"
2,5,352,"00:21:52,070","00:21:55,039","not without our help.
"
2,5,353,"00:21:57,276","00:21:58,709","So how do we stop him?
"
2,5,354,"00:21:58,744","00:22:01,112","<i>We've worked through</i>
<i>the night, My Lord.</i>
"
2,5,355,"00:22:01,146","00:22:03,447","Perhaps we'd profit
from some sleep.
"
2,5,356,"00:22:03,482","00:22:05,516","As I think
you would, Reginald.
"
2,5,357,"00:22:05,551","00:22:07,118","And because
you're my cousin,
"
2,5,358,"00:22:07,152","00:22:09,887","I might even let you
wake from that sleep.
"
2,5,359,"00:22:11,123","00:22:13,458","Go, I'm sure your wife
must miss you.
"
2,5,360,"00:22:13,492","00:22:15,226","My wife's in Lannisport.
"
2,5,361,"00:22:15,260","00:22:17,462","Well, then you'd
better start riding.
"
2,5,362,"00:22:18,897","00:22:22,501","Go before I change my mind
and send her your head.
"
2,5,363,"00:22:22,535","00:22:24,903","If your name
wasn't Lannister,
"
2,5,364,"00:22:24,938","00:22:28,507","you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!
"
2,5,365,"00:22:31,377","00:22:33,045","Not wine, water.
"
2,5,366,"00:22:33,079","00:22:35,247","We'll be here
for some time.
"
2,5,367,"00:22:40,153","00:22:42,888","Girl.
"
2,5,368,"00:22:42,923","00:22:44,924","Where are you from?
"
2,5,369,"00:22:44,958","00:22:46,826","Maidenpool, My Lord.
"
2,5,370,"00:22:46,861","00:22:50,230","And who are the Lords
of Maidenpool?
"
2,5,371,"00:22:50,264","00:22:54,134","- Remind me.
- House Mooton, My Lord.
"
2,5,372,"00:22:54,169","00:22:56,203","And what is their Sigil?
"
2,5,373,"00:23:00,509","00:23:02,143","A red salmon.
"
2,5,374,"00:23:02,177","00:23:05,313","I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.
"
2,5,375,"00:23:06,549","00:23:08,450","You're a northerner,
aren't you?
"
2,5,376,"00:23:09,652","00:23:12,720","Good. One more time,
where are you from?
"
2,5,377,"00:23:12,755","00:23:15,723","Barrowton, My Lord.
House Dustin.
"
2,5,378,"00:23:15,758","00:23:19,828","Two crossed longaxes
beneath a black crown.
"
2,5,379,"00:23:21,764","00:23:25,400","And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?
"
2,5,380,"00:23:27,736","00:23:30,371","They call him
the young wolf.
"
2,5,381,"00:23:30,406","00:23:32,841","And?
"
2,5,382,"00:23:32,876","00:23:35,677","They say he rides into battle on
the back of a giant Direwolf.
"
2,5,383,"00:23:37,981","00:23:41,984","They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.
"
2,5,384,"00:23:42,019","00:23:43,987","They say he can't be killed.
"
2,5,385,"00:23:45,289","00:23:46,924","And do you believe them?
"
2,5,386,"00:23:48,026","00:23:50,828","No, My Lord.
"
2,5,387,"00:23:50,863","00:23:52,997","Anyone can be killed.
"
2,5,388,"00:24:00,239","00:24:02,340","Fetch that water.
"
2,5,389,"00:24:42,915","00:24:45,484","A girl says nothing.
"
2,5,390,"00:24:47,920","00:24:50,355","A girl keeps
her mouth closed.
"
2,5,391,"00:24:50,389","00:24:53,025","<i>No one hears,</i>
"
2,5,392,"00:24:53,059","00:24:56,929","and friends may talk
in secret, yes?
"
2,5,393,"00:25:00,834","00:25:02,735","A boy becomes a girl.
"
2,5,394,"00:25:02,770","00:25:04,371","I was always a girl.
"
2,5,395,"00:25:04,405","00:25:06,607","And I was always aware.
"
2,5,396,"00:25:06,641","00:25:09,343","But the girl
keeps secrets.
"
2,5,397,"00:25:09,378","00:25:12,379","<i>It is not for a man</i>

"
2,5,398,"00:25:14,382","00:25:16,016","You're one of them now.
"
2,5,399,"00:25:18,552","00:25:21,220","I should have let you burn.
"
2,5,400,"00:25:23,289","00:25:25,790","And you fetch water
for one of them now.
"
2,5,401,"00:25:25,825","00:25:29,860","Why is this right for you
and wrong for me?
"
2,5,402,"00:25:29,895","00:25:31,596","I didn't have a choice.
"
2,5,403,"00:25:31,630","00:25:35,700","You did.
I did.
"
2,5,404,"00:25:35,735","00:25:37,369","And here we are.
"
2,5,405,"00:25:40,573","00:25:42,407","A man pays his debts.
"
2,5,406,"00:25:42,441","00:25:44,776","A man owes three.
"
2,5,407,"00:25:44,810","00:25:46,077","Three what?
"
2,5,408,"00:25:46,112","00:25:50,549","The Red God takes
what is his, lovely girl.
"
2,5,409,"00:25:50,583","00:25:53,652","And only death
may pay for life.
"
2,5,410,"00:25:54,788","00:25:57,289","You saved me
and the two I was with.
"
2,5,411,"00:25:57,324","00:26:00,226","You stole three deaths
from the Red God.
"
2,5,412,"00:26:03,797","00:26:05,965","We have to give them back.
"
2,5,413,"00:26:08,869","00:26:11,303","Speak three names
"
2,5,414,"00:26:11,337","00:26:13,906","and the man
will do the rest.
"
2,5,415,"00:26:15,909","00:26:17,643","Three lives
I will give you--
"
2,5,416,"00:26:17,677","00:26:21,013","no more, no less,
and we're done.
"
2,5,417,"00:26:21,047","00:26:23,548","I can name anyone

2,5,419,"00:26:25,952","00:26:29,588","A man has said.
"
2,5,420,"00:26:31,724","00:26:33,158","The one who
tortures everyone.
"
2,5,421,"00:26:33,192","00:26:34,892","A man needs a name.

2,5,422,"00:26:34,927","00:26:37,261","I don't know his name.
"
2,5,423,"00:26:37,296","00:26:39,297","They call him
the Tickler.
"
2,5,424,"00:26:39,331","00:26:41,498","That is enough.
"
2,5,425,"00:26:41,533","00:26:45,635","Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.
"
2,5,426,"00:26:58,983","00:27:00,416","<i>He's not here yet.</i>
"
2,5,427,"00:27:00,451","00:27:02,886","He'd have seen us,
blown the horn.
"
2,5,428,"00:27:02,920","00:27:05,088","When will he come?
"
2,5,429,"00:27:05,123","00:27:07,124","The Halfhand does things
in his own time.
"
2,5,430,"00:27:07,158","00:27:09,426","My uncle told me
stories about him.
"
2,5,431,"00:27:09,461","00:27:11,495","Most of them are true.
"
2,5,432,"00:27:11,530","00:27:14,198","I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the wall.
"
2,5,433,"00:27:14,232","00:27:15,766","The whole winter.
"
2,5,434,"00:27:15,800","00:27:18,468","He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.
"
2,5,435,"00:27:18,503","00:27:20,170","Had to wait for the thaw.
"
2,5,436,"00:27:20,204","00:27:24,173","So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.
"
2,5,437,"00:27:24,207","00:27:27,610","Well, possible
for the Halfhand.
"
2,5,438,"00:27:27,644","00:27:29,445","Beautiful, isn't it?
"
2,5,439,"00:27:29,480","00:27:32,013","Gilly would love it here.
"
2,5,440,"00:27:32,048","00:27:35,650","There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.
"
2,5,441,"00:28:03,077","00:28:05,378","<i>About time you did something.</i>

2,5,442,"00:28:05,412","00:28:08,180","<i>At least you'll keep warm.</i>
"
2,5,443,"00:28:09,750","00:28:12,418","The fist
of the First Men.
"
2,5,444,"00:28:12,453","00:28:15,956","Think of how old
this place is--
"
2,5,445,"00:28:15,990","00:28:18,559","before the Targaryens
defeated the Hendals,
"
2,5,446,"00:28:18,593","00:28:21,362","before the Andals took
Westeros from the First Men.

stop talking.

where we're standing

2,5,450,"00:28:29,973","00:28:32,274","all through the long night.

2,5,451,"00:28:34,344","00:28:36,745","What do you think they
were like, the First Men?
"
2,5,452,"00:28:36,780","00:28:38,380","Stupid.
"
2,5,453,"00:28:38,414","00:28:41,584","Smart people don't find
themselves in places like this.
"
2,5,454,"00:28:41,618","00:28:44,153","I think
they were afraid.
"
2,5,455,"00:28:45,489","00:28:48,224","I think they came here
to get away from something.
"
2,5,456,"00:28:48,258","00:28:51,794","And I don't think
it worked.

2,5,457,"00:28:55,665","00:28:57,266","Wildlings?
"
2,5,458,"00:28:59,636","00:29:02,004","One blast is for rangers returning.
"
2,5,459,"00:29:02,039","00:29:03,706","Wildlings is two blasts.
"
2,5,460,"00:29:03,740","00:29:07,209","So you got to stand
there waiting,
"
2,5,461,"00:29:07,243","00:29:09,310","<i>wondering.</i>
"
2,5,462,"00:29:09,345","00:29:10,979","<i>One blast for friends,</i>

"
2,5,464,"00:29:14,918","00:29:21,257","And three
for White Walkers.
"
2,5,465,"00:29:21,292","00:29:23,193","It's been 1,000 years,
"
2,5,466,"00:29:23,227","00:29:25,963","but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

how do you know?
"
2,5,468,"00:29:29,133","00:29:32,835","- Well...
- I read it in a book.
"
2,5,469,"00:29:32,870","00:29:34,971","Look.
"
2,5,470,"00:29:36,139","00:29:38,273","It's Qhorin Halfhand.

"
2,5,473,"00:29:53,455","00:29:56,324","Take care, My Lord.
"
2,5,474,"00:29:56,358","00:29:59,327","I remember reading
an old sailor's proverb--

and your cock burns off.""
"
2,5,476,"00:30:02,332","00:30:05,968","Oh, I have not conducted
this experiment.
"
2,5,477,"00:30:06,002","00:30:08,604","It could well be true.
"
2,5,478,"00:30:08,639","00:30:10,473","The substance
burns so hot,
"
2,5,479,"00:30:10,507","00:30:13,642","it melts wood,
stone, even steel,
"
2,5,480,"00:30:13,677","00:30:16,979","and, of course, flesh.
"
2,5,481,"00:30:17,013","00:30:21,516","The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.
"
2,5,482,"00:30:24,853","00:30:28,189","After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key
"
2,5,483,"00:30:28,223","00:30:29,991","to the Targaryen power.
"
2,5,484,"00:30:30,025","00:30:33,061","My companion takes issue.

2,5,485,"00:30:33,095","00:30:35,430","If I could tell you
how many crazy old men
"
2,5,486,"00:30:35,464","00:30:37,599","I've seen pushing carts
around army camps
"
2,5,487,"00:30:37,633","00:30:41,336","making grand claims about
jars full of pig shit...
"
2,5,488,"00:30:41,371","00:30:44,606","- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.
"
2,5,489,"00:30:44,641","00:30:47,342","The substance
is fire given form.
"
2,5,490,"00:30:47,376","00:30:50,945","And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.
"
2,5,491,"00:30:50,980","00:30:52,313","To do what?
"
2,5,492,"00:30:52,348","00:30:55,750","The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

2,5,493,"00:30:55,784","00:30:58,452","How much do you have?
"
2,5,494,"00:31:01,289","00:31:05,124","If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,
"
2,5,495,"00:31:05,158","00:31:08,526","then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in 10,
"
2,5,496,"00:31:08,561","00:31:11,695","but all the real soldiers are in
the Riverlands with your father.
"
2,5,497,"00:31:11,729","00:31:14,364","My Lord, this man
is insulting.

ever seen a battle, old man,
"
2,5,499,"00:31:16,735","00:31:18,369","but things can get
a bit messy.
"
2,5,500,"00:31:18,403","00:31:19,770","'Cause when we're flinging
things at Stannis,
"
2,5,501,"00:31:19,804","00:31:21,572","he's flinging them
right back at us.

2,5,502,"00:31:21,606","00:31:24,441","Men die, men shit
themselves, men run,
"
2,5,503,"00:31:24,475","00:31:26,209","which means
pots falling,
"
2,5,504,"00:31:26,244","00:31:28,144","which means fire
inside the walls,
"
2,5,505,"00:31:28,179","00:31:30,445","which means the poor cunts
trying to defend the city
"
2,5,506,"00:31:30,470","00:31:32,470","end up burning it down.
"
2,5,507,"00:31:32,682","00:31:35,050","My friend remains
unconvinced.
"
2,5,508,"00:31:35,084","00:31:37,419","He would not dare
insult my order
"
2,5,509,"00:31:37,453","00:31:39,153","whilst Aerys Targaryen
lived.
"
2,5,510,"00:31:39,188","00:31:41,789","Well, he's not
living anymore.
"
2,5,511,"00:31:41,823","00:31:44,925","And all his pots of wildfire

"
2,5,517,"00:32:18,755","00:32:22,224","enough to burn Stannis

"
2,5,518,"00:32:22,258","00:32:24,359","and armies both.
"
2,5,519,"00:32:24,394","00:32:27,095","This is a shit idea.

gave me a dress,
"

2,5,540,"00:34:24,416","00:34:26,517","You would look like

for a moment.

thing the Dothraki knew how to do

2,5,568,"00:36:36,051","00:36:40,187","Look closely enough and you
can see yourself in them.

"
2,5,781,"00:48:17,497","00:48:19,231","Because I promised

"
2,5,810,"00:49:40,616","00:49:44,085","Let us say half.
"
2,5,811,"00:49:44,120","00:49:48,357","More than enough to buy
horses, ships, armies--
"
2,5,812,"00:49:48,392","00:49:50,493","enough to go home.
"
2,5,813,"00:49:50,527","00:49:53,430","All I have to do?
"
2,5,814,"00:49:53,464","00:49:54,798","Is marry me.

- To take the castle.
"
2,6,54,"00:04:40,024","00:04:44,427","- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

together in the courtyard.

"
2,6,60,"00:04:59,043","00:05:01,010","So you and I can
go down and tell them

"
2,6,69,"00:05:25,838","00:05:28,640","That's what a good
lord would do.

a hasty decision.

we're not fighting an enemy.

you a great gift.

2,6,217,"00:13:24,889","00:13:27,424","You only have one thing
to give in return--

2,6,219,"00:13:28,926","00:13:30,260","I'll gladly give my life.

and fight

2,6,222,"00:13:34,732","00:13:37,166","until your heart's
done pumping.
"
2,6,223,"00:13:37,201","00:13:39,636","And know this, boy--
"
2,6,224,"00:13:39,670","00:13:43,372","your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.
"
2,6,225,"00:13:43,407","00:13:45,607","They'll never know
what you've done.

how you died.

know your damn name,

2,6,228,"00:13:49,311","00:13:52,213","but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard
"
2,6,229,"00:13:52,247","00:13:55,884","north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.
"
2,6,230,"00:13:55,918","00:13:59,053","Now, do you understand me?

2,6,231,"00:13:59,088","00:14:00,822","I do.
"
2,6,232,"00:14:00,856","00:14:03,224","You're even dumber
than you look.
"
2,6,233,"00:14:04,427","00:14:06,494","It's just words, boy,
"
2,6,234,"00:14:06,529","00:14:08,496","to keep us a little
warmer in the night,
"
2,6,235,"00:14:08,530","00:14:11,767","make us feel like
we've got a purpose.
"
2,6,236,"00:14:11,801","00:14:14,236","Come on.
"
2,6,237,"00:14:14,270","00:14:16,605","We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls
"
2,6,238,"00:14:16,630","00:14:18,219","and they find us.

2,6,239,"00:14:29,889","00:14:32,457","- Can you read?
- My Lord?

our infantry movements

2,6,242,"00:14:41,634","00:14:44,302","was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.
"
2,6,243,"00:14:44,337","00:14:48,140","It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

2,6,252,"00:15:27,848","00:15:29,949","I judged you might be
good for something more

2,6,253,"00:15:29,983","00:15:32,551","than brutalizing peasants.
"
2,6,254,"00:15:32,586","00:15:34,953","I see I overestimated you.

2,6,257,"00:15:50,335","00:15:51,769","Put the book away, girl.
"
2,6,258,"00:15:58,643","00:16:02,279","Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

2,6,259,"00:16:08,257","00:16:10,475","- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.
"
2,6,260,"00:16:11,322","00:16:13,457","Give us the room.
"
2,6,261,"00:16:21,133","00:16:22,968","Clear all this.

from the capital?
"
2,6,265,"00:16:44,623","00:16:48,025","I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

2,6,266,"00:16:48,060","00:16:50,227","Ah, the late king Renly.
"
2,6,267,"00:16:50,261","00:16:52,463","Rather a short reign.
"
2,6,268,"00:16:52,498","00:16:54,499","Murdered by a woman,
I hear.
"
2,6,269,"00:16:54,534","00:16:56,468","So they say.
"
2,6,270,"00:16:56,502","00:17:01,641","There has been talk
of other forces at work,
"
2,6,271,"00:17:01,676","00:17:04,110","dark forces.

2,6,272,"00:17:04,145","00:17:06,547","Here.

unravel.
"
2,6,275,"00:17:14,756","00:17:17,558","It is my belief
that a moment of chaos
"
2,6,276,"00:17:17,593","00:17:19,994","affords opportunities
lost soon after.
"
2,6,277,"00:17:20,028","00:17:23,164","You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

2,6,278,"00:17:23,198","00:17:26,333","Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

have you brought me today?

fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,
"
2,6,283,"00:17:35,243","00:17:39,179","- feeding horses and soldiers.

"
2,6,284,"00:17:39,214","00:17:43,618","The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

Stannis for Renly's death.

2,6,305,"00:18:51,453","00:18:52,988","What else?

- A wildling.
"
2,6,312,"00:19:58,522","00:19:59,856","We could question her.
"
2,6,313,"00:19:59,890","00:20:01,858","You could.

2,6,314,"00:20:01,893","00:20:03,493","She won't answer.

2,6,315,"00:20:03,528","00:20:06,997","I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

- Ygritte.
"
2,6,317,"00:20:11,269","00:20:14,337","She was reaching for this axe

2,6,537,"00:34:27,427","00:34:29,561","There are many there
that support my claim.
"
2,6,538,"00:34:29,596","00:34:31,063","When were you
there last?
"
2,6,539,"00:34:32,065","00:34:33,699","I left when
I was a baby.
"
2,6,540,"00:34:33,734","00:34:36,636","So, in truth,
you have no allies.
"
2,6,541,"00:34:36,671","00:34:39,426","The people will rise
to fight for their rightful
"
2,6,542,"00:34:39,451","00:34:41,141","Queen when I return.
"
2,6,543,"00:34:41,142","00:34:43,010","Ah.
"
2,6,544,"00:34:43,044","00:34:44,812","Forgive me,
little princess,
"
2,6,545,"00:34:44,846","00:34:48,283","but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.
"
2,6,546,"00:34:48,317","00:34:49,784","Now if you'll pardon me.
"
2,6,547,"00:34:49,819","00:34:52,520","Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?
"
2,6,548,"00:34:52,555","00:34:55,190","Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.
"
2,6,549,"00:34:55,224","00:34:58,826","For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.
"
2,6,550,"00:34:58,861","00:35:01,729","<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>
"
2,6,551,"00:35:01,763","00:35:03,697","that the ages
had turned them to stone.
"
2,6,552,"00:35:03,732","00:35:06,934","How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?
"
2,6,553,"00:35:06,968","00:35:09,936","But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs
"
2,6,554,"00:35:09,970","00:35:12,439","into a great fire,
they would hatch.
"
2,6,555,"00:35:12,473","00:35:17,011","When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.
"
2,6,556,"00:35:17,045","00:35:19,213","But when the fire
burned out,
"
2,6,557,"00:35:19,248","00:35:21,449","I was unhurt,
"
2,6,558,"00:35:21,483","00:35:24,319","the Mother of Dragons.
"
2,6,559,"00:35:26,889","00:35:29,157","Do you understand?
"
2,6,560,"00:35:31,728","00:35:34,296","I'm no ordinary woman.
"
2,6,561,"00:35:34,330","00:35:37,298","My dreams come true.
"
2,6,562,"00:35:42,071","00:35:44,338","I admire your passion.
"
2,6,563,"00:35:45,940","00:35:49,243","But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.
"
2,6,564,"00:35:49,277","00:35:50,944","I'm sorry, little princess.
"
2,6,565,"00:35:50,978","00:35:53,313","I am not
your little princess.
"
2,6,566,"00:35:53,347","00:35:56,383","I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria
"
2,6,567,"00:35:56,417","00:35:58,419","and I will take
what is mine.
"
2,6,568,"00:35:58,453","00:36:01,555","With fire and blood,
I will take it.
"
2,6,569,"00:36:01,589","00:36:05,159","Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.
"
2,6,570,"00:36:22,576","00:36:25,712","Who taught you to read?
"
2,6,571,"00:36:25,746","00:36:28,014","My father, My Lord.
"
2,6,572,"00:36:28,049","00:36:30,017","Hmm.
"
2,6,573,"00:36:30,051","00:36:32,252","I taught my son
Jaime to read.
"
2,6,574,"00:36:35,256","00:36:37,257","The Maester came
to me one day,
"
2,6,575,"00:36:37,291","00:36:39,459","told me he wasn't learning.
"
2,6,576,"00:36:39,494","00:36:42,262","He couldn't make sense
of the letters.
"
2,6,577,"00:36:42,297","00:36:44,999","He reversed them
in his head.
"
2,6,578,"00:36:45,033","00:36:47,869","The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction
"
2,6,579,"00:36:47,903","00:36:49,938","and that we simply
must accept it.
"
2,6,580,"00:36:49,972","00:36:52,040","Ha!
"
2,6,581,"00:36:52,075","00:36:55,544","After that,
I sat Jaime down
"
2,6,582,"00:36:55,579","00:36:58,748","for four hours every day
until he learned.
"
2,6,583,"00:36:58,782","00:37:03,987","He hated me for it,
for a time.
"
2,6,584,"00:37:04,022","00:37:06,657","For a long time,
"
2,6,585,"00:37:06,692","00:37:08,526","but he learned.
"
2,6,586,"00:37:13,298","00:37:16,400","Where is your father?
Is he alive?
"
2,6,587,"00:37:19,370","00:37:20,904","Who was he?
"
2,6,588,"00:37:20,938","00:37:23,540","A stonemason.
"
2,6,589,"00:37:23,574","00:37:25,874","A stonemason
who could read?
"
2,6,590,"00:37:25,909","00:37:28,310","- Hmm.
- He taught himself.
"
2,6,591,"00:37:28,344","00:37:31,079","Quite a man.
"
2,6,592,"00:37:32,114","00:37:34,416","What killed him?
"
2,6,593,"00:37:36,018","00:37:38,152","Loyalty.
"
2,6,594,"00:37:39,689","00:37:41,857","You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?
"
2,6,595,"00:37:45,228","00:37:46,528","Did...
"
2,6,596,"00:37:48,331","00:37:51,667","Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.
"
2,6,597,"00:37:52,670","00:37:54,937","No...
"
2,6,598,"00:37:54,972","00:37:57,874","But you've already begun.
"
2,6,599,"00:37:57,908","00:38:01,344","Did you know
your father, My Lord?
"
2,6,600,"00:38:01,378","00:38:03,513","I did.
"
2,6,601,"00:38:04,949","00:38:06,717","I grew up with him.
"
2,6,602,"00:38:08,653","00:38:11,589","I watched him
grow old.
"
2,6,603,"00:38:15,161","00:38:16,862","<i>He loved us.</i>
"
2,6,604,"00:38:16,896","00:38:19,698","He was a good man,
"
2,6,605,"00:38:19,733","00:38:22,434","but a weak man,
"
2,6,606,"00:38:22,469","00:38:25,971","a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.
"
2,6,607,"00:38:28,542","00:38:30,376","I'm cold.
"
2,6,608,"00:38:30,411","00:38:33,112","I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.
"
2,6,609,"00:38:33,147","00:38:35,515","Mmm.
"
2,6,610,"00:39:01,976","00:39:03,643","Where are you going, girl?
"
2,6,611,"00:39:03,678","00:39:06,613","The armory,
My Lord.
"
2,6,612,"00:39:06,648","00:39:08,249","Why?
"
2,6,613,"00:39:08,283","00:39:10,117","Lord Tywin sent me.
"
2,6,614,"00:39:12,087","00:39:14,355","What might this be?
"
2,6,615,"00:39:14,389","00:39:17,291","Lord Tywin gave it to me.
"
2,6,616,"00:39:17,325","00:39:19,393","What for?
"
2,6,617,"00:39:19,427","00:39:22,262","To take to the armory.
"
2,6,618,"00:39:22,297","00:39:24,798","Why would he do that?
"
2,6,619,"00:39:26,768","00:39:28,402","Let's go and ask him.
"
2,6,620,"00:39:31,005","00:39:33,307","Move!
"
2,6,621,"00:39:34,809","00:39:37,278","Get out of the way!
"
2,6,622,"00:40:06,942","00:40:08,876","Amory Lorch.
"
2,6,623,"00:40:08,910","00:40:10,911","A girl has named
a second name.
"
2,6,624,"00:40:10,946","00:40:12,513","A man will do
what must be done.
"
2,6,625,"00:40:12,547","00:40:14,482","Now!
"
2,6,626,"00:40:14,516","00:40:18,386","A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.
"
2,6,627,"00:40:18,421","00:40:20,689","A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.
"
2,6,628,"00:40:20,723","00:40:22,658","But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.
"
2,6,629,"00:40:22,692","00:40:25,694","It has to be now.
"
2,6,630,"00:40:32,870","00:40:34,970","Guard!
"
2,6,631,"00:40:44,247","00:40:46,581","- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.
"
2,6,632,"00:40:50,453","00:40:52,987","My honor, Your Grace.
"
2,6,633,"00:40:53,022","00:40:55,456","Your Grace.
"
2,6,634,"00:41:00,529","00:41:03,063","- Your Grace.
- Quent.
"
2,6,635,"00:41:24,020","00:41:25,887","Lady Talisa.
"
2,6,636,"00:41:26,889","00:41:28,490","Your Grace.
"
2,6,637,"00:41:30,260","00:41:32,061","I'm not sure I'm a lady.
"
2,6,638,"00:41:32,095","00:41:34,229","Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.
"
2,6,639,"00:41:34,264","00:41:36,665","It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.
"
2,6,640,"00:41:36,699","00:41:39,801","But if I remember
my lessons,
"
2,6,641,"00:41:39,836","00:41:42,370","a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady
"
2,6,642,"00:41:42,405","00:41:44,905","unless she's a queen
or a princess.
"
2,6,643,"00:41:44,940","00:41:47,140","I could find
someone who knows.
"
2,6,644,"00:41:47,175","00:41:49,743","Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?
"
2,6,645,"00:41:49,777","00:41:51,811","Because it's obvious.
"
2,6,646,"00:41:51,845","00:41:55,481","What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge
"
2,6,647,"00:41:55,516","00:41:58,451","and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?
"
2,6,648,"00:41:59,953","00:42:01,320","I'd call you a liar.
"
2,6,649,"00:42:01,355","00:42:04,757","Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.
"
2,6,650,"00:42:09,028","00:42:10,896","I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.
"
2,6,651,"00:42:11,998","00:42:14,299","Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.
"
2,6,652,"00:42:19,404","00:42:20,972","Quite a pretty spot.
"
2,6,653,"00:42:21,006","00:42:23,641","Will we be here long?
"
2,6,654,"00:42:23,675","00:42:26,410","I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.
"
2,6,655,"00:42:26,444","00:42:28,879","I'm not a spy.
"
2,6,656,"00:42:28,913","00:42:31,981","Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.
"
2,6,657,"00:42:33,284","00:42:35,819","You're right.
You've found me out.
"
2,6,658,"00:42:35,853","00:42:37,587","I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.
"
2,6,659,"00:42:37,622","00:42:40,057","""The young wolf
is on the move.""
"
2,6,660,"00:42:41,960","00:42:43,795","Perhaps you'd join me...

2,6,661,"00:42:45,298","00:42:48,100","If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

2,6,663,"00:42:51,604","00:42:53,739","Mother.
"
2,6,664,"00:42:59,512","00:43:02,381","Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

2,6,665,"00:43:02,415","00:43:04,683","She's been helping
with the wounded.
"
2,6,666,"00:43:04,717","00:43:07,619","She's been very...
helpful.
"
2,6,667,"00:43:07,653","00:43:09,187","Lady Talisa.
"
2,6,668,"00:43:09,221","00:43:10,888","Lady Stark.
"
2,6,669,"00:43:10,923","00:43:12,756","Lady Talisa...?
"
2,6,670,"00:43:12,791","00:43:16,360","- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?
"
2,6,671,"00:43:16,395","00:43:19,330","Forgive me,
I do not know this name.
"
2,6,672,"00:43:19,365","00:43:22,434","An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.
"
2,6,673,"00:43:23,503","00:43:26,639","Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.
"
2,6,674,"00:43:35,216","00:43:36,884","I've missed you.
"
2,6,675,"00:43:36,918","00:43:40,321","Yes, you look
positively forlorn.
"
2,6,676,"00:43:40,355","00:43:43,190","You surprised me,
that's all.
"
2,6,677,"00:43:43,225","00:43:46,394","I didn't think
I'd see you today.
"
2,6,678,"00:43:46,428","00:43:48,796","I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.
"
2,6,679,"00:43:48,831","00:43:50,264","I know.
"
2,6,680,"00:43:50,299","00:43:52,967","You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.
"
2,6,681,"00:43:53,001","00:43:55,803","I'm afraid they come
at a cost.
"
2,6,682,"00:43:55,837","00:43:59,240","- I know.
- You are promised to another--
"
2,6,683,"00:44:00,142","00:44:03,744","a debt that must be paid.
"
2,6,684,"00:44:03,779","00:44:06,147","- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.
"
2,6,685,"00:44:06,182","00:44:09,918","My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

2,6,687,"00:44:25,134","00:44:27,368","I can tell you
which way to go.

2,6,688,"00:44:27,403","00:44:30,038","We'll stop here.
"
2,6,689,"00:44:30,072","00:44:32,040","Too dark to go
any farther today.

shelter here.

anywhere.

2,6,692,"00:44:36,445","00:44:39,181","There is if you know
where to look.

2,6,693,"00:44:42,618","00:44:44,586","The cold
could kill us both.

2,6,700,"00:45:37,041","00:45:39,176","Think they're out
looking for you?

2,8,727,"00:43:07,800","00:43:09,967","- and he ran.
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
"
2,8,728,"00:43:10,002","00:43:13,038","Shut up.
Stay here if you're afraid.
"
2,8,729,"00:43:15,808","00:43:18,076","Hot Pie:
Arry, don't.
"
2,8,730,"00:43:46,341","00:43:48,776","Away!
Reset!
"
2,8,731,"00:43:56,983","00:44:00,519","If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's Landing in a day.
"
2,8,732,"00:44:00,553","00:44:02,120","Will it hold?
"
2,8,733,"00:44:02,155","00:44:04,656","Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.
"
2,8,734,"00:44:05,859","00:44:08,260","Man:
<i>Again, pull!</i>
"
2,8,735,"00:44:11,665","00:44:13,266","I admire you, Ser Davos.
"
2,8,736,"00:44:13,300","00:44:16,570","I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.
"
2,8,737,"00:44:16,604","00:44:18,939","Some highborn fools
call you Onion Knight
"
2,8,738,"00:44:18,974","00:44:20,608","and think
they insult you.
"
2,8,739,"00:44:20,642","00:44:22,944","So you take the onion
for your sigil,
"
2,8,740,"00:44:22,978","00:44:25,446","sew it on your coat,
fly the onion flag.
"
2,8,741,"00:44:25,481","00:44:27,682","My son wishes me
to change it.
"
2,8,742,"00:44:27,716","00:44:30,918","Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.
"
2,8,743,"00:44:30,952","00:44:34,755","I understand why the older
families look down at me.
"
2,8,744,"00:44:34,789","00:44:37,023","Do you?
Why?
"
2,8,745,"00:44:37,058","00:44:40,059","- My father was a crabber.
- And?
"
2,8,746,"00:44:40,094","00:44:43,663","Well, sons of Lords don't like to
break bread with sons of crabbers.
"
2,8,747,"00:44:43,697","00:44:45,598","Our hands stink.
"
2,8,748,"00:44:45,633","00:44:48,201","And where were those Lords
when Storm's End starved?
"
2,8,749,"00:44:48,235","00:44:50,537","Many fought bravely
for your brother.
"
2,8,750,"00:44:50,571","00:44:53,072","Many fought
for the Mad King.
"
2,8,751,"00:44:53,106","00:44:57,077","You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.
"
2,8,752,"00:44:57,112","00:44:59,413","Some are happy
to do it to my face.
"
2,8,753,"00:44:59,448","00:45:01,683","We were forgotten.
"
2,8,754,"00:45:01,717","00:45:04,352","Robert and Ned Stark--
they were the heroes,
"
2,8,755,"00:45:04,387","00:45:08,089","the glorious rebels marching
from battle to battle,
"
2,8,756,"00:45:08,124","00:45:10,725","liberating towns from
the yoke of the Mad King
"
2,8,757,"00:45:10,759","00:45:13,427","while I held Storm's End
with 500 men.
"
2,8,758,"00:45:13,461","00:45:15,395","- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.
"
2,8,759,"00:45:15,430","00:45:17,530","He gave Storm's End
to Renly after the war.
"
2,8,760,"00:45:17,565","00:45:19,098","Renly never fought
a day in his life.
"
2,8,761,"00:45:19,133","00:45:22,168","- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
"
2,8,762,"00:45:25,772","00:45:27,673","First we ate the horses.
"
2,8,763,"00:45:27,707","00:45:31,044","We weren't riding anyway,
not with the castle surrounded.
"
2,8,764,"00:45:31,078","00:45:33,747","We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.
"
2,8,765,"00:45:33,781","00:45:35,782","Then the cats.
Never liked cats.
"
2,8,766,"00:45:35,816","00:45:38,553","So fine.
I do like dogs.
"
2,8,767,"00:45:38,587","00:45:40,221","Good animals.
Loyal.
"
2,8,768,"00:45:40,256","00:45:42,691","But we ate them.
Then the rats.
"
2,8,769,"00:45:42,725","00:45:44,927","The night before
you slipped through,
"
2,8,770,"00:45:44,961","00:45:46,829","I thought my wife
was dying.
"
2,8,771,"00:45:46,863","00:45:49,097","She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.
"
2,8,772,"00:45:49,132","00:45:52,301","And then you made it
through the lines.
"
2,8,773,"00:45:52,335","00:45:55,671","Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.
"
2,8,774,"00:45:55,705","00:45:58,473","And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.
"
2,8,775,"00:45:58,508","00:46:01,243","Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.
"
2,8,776,"00:46:01,277","00:46:03,612","I was relieved
they did not.
"
2,8,777,"00:46:05,349","00:46:08,784","Robert told me to hold
Storm's End, so I held it.
"
2,8,778,"00:46:10,187","00:46:12,288","Then he told me
he was giving it to Renly,
"
2,8,779,"00:46:12,323","00:46:13,623","so I gave it up.
"
2,8,780,"00:46:13,657","00:46:16,059","Insult or no,
I gave it up
"
2,8,781,"00:46:16,093","00:46:18,361","because Robert was my older brother
and he was the king
"
2,8,782,"00:46:18,396","00:46:20,564","and I've always
done my duty.
"
2,8,783,"00:46:20,598","00:46:24,534","But now I'm the rightful king by
every law of Westeros.
"
2,8,784,"00:46:24,569","00:46:27,137","And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.
"
2,8,785,"00:46:29,975","00:46:31,976","Your Grace...
"
2,8,786,"00:46:33,812","00:46:35,847","I pray I serve you well.
"
2,8,787,"00:46:37,416","00:46:40,084","I expect you'll be the first crabber's
son to wear the badge.
"
2,8,788,"00:46:44,790","00:46:46,591","You're the master
of whisperers.
"
2,8,789,"00:46:46,625","00:46:48,359","You're supposed
to know everything.
"
2,8,790,"00:46:48,393","00:46:51,296","No man can be in all
rooms at all times.
"
2,8,791,"00:46:51,330","00:46:54,366","I have many little birds
in the North, My Lord,
"
2,8,792,"00:46:54,400","00:46:56,201","but I haven't heard
their songs
"
2,8,793,"00:46:56,235","00:46:58,936","since Theon Greyjoy
captured Winterfell.
"
2,8,794,"00:46:58,971","00:47:00,572","The Stark forces
are distracted.
"
2,8,795,"00:47:00,606","00:47:02,540","Now is the time
to strike.
"
2,8,796,"00:47:02,575","00:47:04,308","To strike?
"
2,8,797,"00:47:04,343","00:47:06,310","My dear nephew,
you do see these men
"
2,8,798,"00:47:06,345","00:47:08,012","preparing the walls
for siege?
"
2,8,799,"00:47:08,046","00:47:11,582","You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
"
2,8,800,"00:47:11,616","00:47:14,017","If my Uncle Stannis lands on
the shores of King's Landing,
"
2,8,801,"00:47:14,052","00:47:16,019","I'll ride out
to greet him.
"
2,8,802,"00:47:16,053","00:47:17,954","A brave choice,
Your Grace.
"
2,8,803,"00:47:17,989","00:47:20,823","I'm sure your men
will line up behind you.
"
2,8,804,"00:47:20,857","00:47:23,759","They say Stannis
never smiles.
"
2,8,805,"00:47:23,793","00:47:26,461","I'll give him
a red smile
"
2,8,806,"00:47:26,496","00:47:28,630","from ear to ear.
"
2,8,807,"00:47:33,103","00:47:36,005","Imagine Stannis's terror.
"
2,8,808,"00:47:36,039","00:47:38,107","I am trying.
"
2,8,809,"00:47:39,276","00:47:41,010","You're
an intelligent man.
"
2,8,810,"00:47:41,044","00:47:42,745","I'd like to think
I'm an intelligent man.
"
2,8,811,"00:47:42,780","00:47:44,347","Oh, no one disputes
that, My Lord,
"
2,8,812,"00:47:44,381","00:47:46,649","not even the multitudes
who despise you.
"
2,8,813,"00:47:46,684","00:47:49,586","I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.
"
2,8,814,"00:47:49,621","00:47:51,455","I wish we could, too.
"
2,8,815,"00:47:53,725","00:47:55,693","What do you want?

2,8,816,"00:47:55,727","00:47:57,929","Tell me.
"
2,8,817,"00:47:57,963","00:47:59,831","If we're going to play,
"
2,8,818,"00:47:59,865","00:48:02,167","you'll have to start.
"
2,8,819,"00:48:06,372","00:48:10,307","My brother was the youngest
Kingsguard in history.
"
2,8,820,"00:48:10,342","00:48:14,144","My sister became queen
at the age of 19.
"
2,8,821,"00:48:15,813","00:48:17,580","When I reached manhood,
"
2,8,822,"00:48:17,615","00:48:19,441","my father put me
in charge of all the drains
"
2,8,823,"00:48:19,466","00:48:21,327","and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
"
2,8,824,"00:48:21,685","00:48:23,719","A most highborn plumber.
"
2,8,825,"00:48:23,754","00:48:25,855","The water never
flowed better.
"
2,8,826,"00:48:25,889","00:48:28,825","And all the shit
found its way to the sea.
"
2,8,827,"00:48:28,859","00:48:31,662","I never expected
to have any real power.
"
2,8,828,"00:48:31,696","00:48:33,898","So when my father
named me acting Hand--
"
2,8,829,"00:48:33,933","00:48:36,034","You're quite good
at being Hand, you know?
"
2,8,830,"00:48:36,068","00:48:38,904","Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
were good men,
"
2,8,831,"00:48:38,938","00:48:40,972","honorable men,
"
2,8,832,"00:48:41,007","00:48:43,843","but they disdained the game
and those who played.
"
2,8,833,"00:48:43,877","00:48:46,412","- You enjoy the game.
- I do.
"
2,8,834,"00:48:46,446","00:48:48,948","Last thing I expected.
"
2,8,835,"00:48:48,982","00:48:50,449","And you play it well.
"
2,8,836,"00:48:50,483","00:48:52,551","I'd like to keep
playing it.
"
2,8,837,"00:48:55,055","00:48:57,990","If Stannis breaches
the gates, the game is over.
"
2,8,838,"00:48:58,024","00:49:00,658","They say he burns
his enemies alive

2,8,839,"00:49:00,693","00:49:02,728","to honor
the Lord of Light.
"
2,8,840,"00:49:02,762","00:49:05,096","The Lord of Light

2,8,842,"00:49:07,667","00:49:09,668","Why are all the Gods
such vicious cunts?

goddess with 16 teats.

2,8,846,"00:49:18,245","00:49:20,913","We should sail there

"
2,8,847,"00:49:22,750","00:49:26,119","This morning
I heard a song

they say is true,

they are fully grown.

2,8,854,"00:49:45,538","00:49:48,206","And then there will be
nowhere to hide.

2,10,162,"00:11:45,097","00:11:48,098","Here, watch me.
"
2,10,163,"00:11:52,003","00:11:53,970","No need for that,
my dear.
"
2,10,164,"00:11:54,005","00:11:55,439","You sure?
"
2,10,165,"00:11:55,473","00:11:57,441","Most men like
what they see.
"
2,10,166,"00:11:57,475","00:11:59,110","I'm not like
most men.
"
2,10,167,"00:11:59,144","00:12:01,612","<i>That's what most men say.</i>
"
2,10,168,"00:12:01,647","00:12:05,116","If you don't want
what most men want,
"
2,10,169,"00:12:05,151","00:12:07,820","then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.
"
2,10,170,"00:12:09,289","00:12:12,859","I would like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish
"
2,10,171,"00:12:12,893","00:12:15,328","has been all you'd
hoped it would be.
"
2,10,172,"00:12:16,597","00:12:18,064","Have we met?
"
2,10,173,"00:12:18,098","00:12:20,800","You wouldn't
remember me if we had?
"
2,10,174,"00:12:20,835","00:12:22,468","I meet a lot of men.
"
2,10,175,"00:12:22,503","00:12:24,971","And I think you
remember all of them.
"
2,10,176,"00:12:25,005","00:12:28,608","I think your true talents
are wasted on them.
"
2,10,177,"00:12:28,642","00:12:31,411","You're very kind,
My Lord.
"
2,10,178,"00:12:31,478","00:12:33,879","Allow me to return
the favor.
"
2,10,179,"00:12:40,788","00:12:42,755","You're afraid.
"
2,10,180,"00:12:42,789","00:12:45,591","Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.
"
2,10,181,"00:12:45,626","00:12:48,027","I know who you are.
"
2,10,182,"00:12:48,061","00:12:51,230","And, unlike your
current employer,
"
2,10,183,"00:12:51,264","00:12:53,966","I protect those
who work for me.
"
2,10,184,"00:12:54,001","00:12:57,070","I don't abuse them
to satisfy royal whims
"
2,10,185,"00:12:57,104","00:12:59,672","or force them
to abuse each other.
"
2,10,186,"00:12:59,707","00:13:01,441","How do you know
about that?
"
2,10,187,"00:13:01,475","00:13:04,945","I thought you said
you knew who I was.
"
2,10,188,"00:13:06,814","00:13:09,116","What can I do for you,
Lord Varys?
"
2,10,189,"00:13:21,862","00:13:23,563","Littlefinger looks at you
"
2,10,190,"00:13:23,597","00:13:26,032","and sees a collection
of profitable holes.
"
2,10,191,"00:13:26,066","00:13:29,435","I see a potential
partner.
"
2,10,192,"00:13:30,804","00:13:34,874","- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.
"
2,10,193,"00:13:34,908","00:13:37,577","He's a dangerous man.
"
2,10,194,"00:13:37,611","00:13:40,880","But everyone has
their weaknesses.
"
2,10,195,"00:13:40,914","00:13:45,085","Your current employer
hides his very well,
"
2,10,196,"00:13:45,119","00:13:47,554","but not as well
as he thinks.
"
2,10,197,"00:13:52,027","00:13:54,296","You're a virgin,
I take it?
"
2,10,198,"00:13:54,330","00:13:56,397","Walk.
"
2,10,199,"00:13:57,700","00:14:00,101","Childhood must have
been awful for you.
"
2,10,200,"00:14:00,135","00:14:03,338","Were you a foot taller
than all the boys?
"
2,10,201,"00:14:03,372","00:14:06,341","They laughed at you,
called you names?
"
2,10,202,"00:14:06,376","00:14:08,644","Some boys
like a challenge.
"
2,10,203,"00:14:08,678","00:14:12,115","One or two must have
tried to get inside big Brienne.
"
2,10,204,"00:14:12,149","00:14:15,185","- One or two tried.
- Ah.
"
2,10,205,"00:14:15,219","00:14:17,420","But you fought them off.
"
2,10,206,"00:14:17,455","00:14:20,490","But maybe you wished one
of them could overpower you,
"
2,10,207,"00:14:20,524","00:14:22,959","fling you down,
tear off your clothes.
"
2,10,208,"00:14:22,994","00:14:25,395","But none of them
were strong enough.
"
2,10,209,"00:14:25,430","00:14:27,698","- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.
"
2,10,210,"00:14:27,733","00:14:29,267","Of course you are.
"
2,10,211,"00:14:29,301","00:14:32,003","You'd love to know what it
feels like to be a woman.
"
2,10,212,"00:14:35,107","00:14:38,509","<i>Ah. ""They lay</i>
<i>with lions.""</i>
"
2,10,213,"00:14:38,543","00:14:40,210","Tavern girls, I'd say.
"
2,10,214,"00:14:40,245","00:14:43,280","Probably served
my father's soldiers.
"
2,10,215,"00:14:43,314","00:14:46,449","Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.
"
2,10,216,"00:14:46,483","00:14:48,984","That's how
they earned this.
"
2,10,217,"00:14:49,019","00:14:52,888","The glorious work of the
northern freedom fighters.
"
2,10,218,"00:14:52,922","00:14:55,157","Must make you proud
to serve the Starks.
"
2,10,219,"00:14:55,192","00:14:59,162","I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.
"
2,10,220,"00:14:59,196","00:15:02,098","Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.
"
2,10,221,"00:15:06,705","00:15:08,873","- What are you doing?
- Burying them.
"
2,10,222,"00:15:08,907","00:15:12,344","We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.
"
2,10,223,"00:15:12,378","00:15:14,513","I think these women
would understand if--
"
2,10,224,"00:15:14,581","00:15:16,014","I don't care
what you think.
"
2,10,225,"00:15:16,048","00:15:17,415","<i>I didn't leave it here.</i>
"
2,10,226,"00:15:17,450","00:15:19,551","Untie me now.
"
2,10,227,"00:15:19,585","00:15:21,350","<i>I gave it to you to cut</i>

"
2,10,228,"00:15:21,375","00:15:22,753","<i>have me dagger no more.</i>
"
2,10,229,"00:15:22,754","00:15:25,256","So unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt,
"
2,10,230,"00:15:25,290","00:15:28,258","it stands to reason
that it's gone-- whoa!
"
2,10,231,"00:15:29,660","00:15:31,394","What's your business here?
"
2,10,232,"00:15:31,428","00:15:33,395","Traveling a prisoner.
"
2,10,233,"00:15:35,933","00:15:39,202","You're a woman.
A woman!
"
2,10,234,"00:15:39,237","00:15:41,305","<i>Well, fuck me!</i>
"
2,10,235,"00:15:41,339","00:15:44,008","If you've quite
finished up--
"
2,10,236,"00:15:46,045","00:15:47,912","All right,
we'll be going.
"
2,10,237,"00:15:47,947","00:15:50,582","Whoa, whoa.
"
2,10,238,"00:15:50,616","00:15:52,317","Who do you fight for?
"
2,10,239,"00:15:52,351","00:15:54,819","The Starks.
"
2,10,240,"00:15:56,555","00:15:59,023","What did he do?
"
2,10,241,"00:15:59,057","00:16:02,159","Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew?
"
2,10,242,"00:16:02,193","00:16:03,594","No, stealing is a crime.
"
2,10,243,"00:16:03,628","00:16:06,063","But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.
"
2,10,244,"00:16:06,097","00:16:08,265","- <i>Where are you taking him?</i>
- To Riverrun.
"
2,10,245,"00:16:08,299","00:16:10,066","Why Riverrun?
"
2,10,246,"00:16:10,100","00:16:12,835","Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.
"
2,10,247,"00:16:12,870","00:16:15,337","- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?
"
2,10,248,"00:16:15,372","00:16:17,373","I don't give the orders.
"
2,10,249,"00:16:17,407","00:16:18,941","He must be important
to someone.
"
2,10,250,"00:16:18,975","00:16:22,144","Sending him with you?
How important could he be?
"
2,10,251,"00:16:23,146","00:16:25,915","All right,
have it your way,
"
2,10,252,"00:16:25,949","00:16:27,950","m'lady.
"
2,10,253,"00:16:30,688","00:16:34,157","- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?
"
2,10,254,"00:16:34,192","00:16:36,326","- <i>No.</i>
- Then you don't know me.
"
2,10,255,"00:16:36,361","00:16:39,496","Do you ever go to the river
market at Salt Rock?
"
2,10,256,"00:16:39,531","00:16:42,066","- Is it near Ashemark?
- <i>No.</i>
"
2,10,257,"00:16:42,100","00:16:43,501","I've never been there.
"
2,10,258,"00:16:43,535","00:16:46,304","What do you think
of these beauties?
"
2,10,259,"00:16:47,807","00:16:49,842","I hope you gave them
quick deaths.
"
2,10,260,"00:16:49,876","00:16:52,812","Two of them we did, yeah.
"
2,10,261,"00:16:54,648","00:16:57,216","Wait.
"
2,10,262,"00:16:58,953","00:17:01,487","I do know you.
"
2,10,263,"00:17:01,522","00:17:03,489","That's Jaime Lannister.
"
2,10,264,"00:17:03,524","00:17:04,967","I wish someone had told me.
"
2,10,265,"00:17:04,992","00:17:06,559","I wouldn't have had
to steal that pig.
"
2,10,266,"00:17:06,560","00:17:08,895","If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.
"
2,10,267,"00:17:08,930","00:17:10,731","How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?
"
2,10,268,"00:17:10,765","00:17:12,967","I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.
"
2,10,269,"00:17:13,001","00:17:15,870","<i>They dragged him out of the woods</i>
<i>and threw him down before the King.</i>
"
2,10,270,"00:17:15,904","00:17:18,439","He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.
"
2,10,271,"00:17:18,473","00:17:20,541","If he was, I'd only
be traveling his head.
"
2,10,272,"00:17:20,575","00:17:22,710","I have a question
for you both.
"
2,10,273,"00:17:22,744","00:17:25,112","And I want you to answer it
at the same time.
"
2,10,274,"00:17:25,146","00:17:27,748","<i>I count to three,</i>
<i>you both answer.</i>
"
2,10,275,"00:17:27,783","00:17:30,184","What's his name?
"
2,10,276,"00:17:30,218","00:17:32,553","One.
"
2,10,277,"00:17:32,587","00:17:35,389","<i>Two. Three.</i>
"
2,10,278,"00:17:50,271","00:17:52,272","Two quick deaths.
"
2,10,279,"00:18:19,998","00:18:22,266","Those were Stark men.
"
2,10,280,"00:18:22,300","00:18:25,335","I don't serve the Starks.
"
2,10,281,"00:18:25,370","00:18:27,270","I serve Lady Catelyn.
"
2,10,282,"00:18:27,304","00:18:29,806","I told her I'd take you
to King's Landing,
"
2,10,283,"00:18:29,840","00:18:31,774","and that's what
I'm going to do.
"
2,10,284,"00:18:34,044","00:18:35,745","Stay.
"
2,10,285,"00:18:53,267","00:18:56,402","Walder Frey is a dangerous
man to cross.
"
2,10,286,"00:18:56,436","00:18:58,037","I know that.
"
2,10,287,"00:18:58,071","00:19:00,239","And you mean
to do it anyway?
"
2,10,288,"00:19:03,944","00:19:06,146","I love her.
"
2,10,289,"00:19:06,180","00:19:08,548","I know that seems
important to you.
"
2,10,290,"00:19:08,582","00:19:10,516","It is important to me.
"
2,10,291,"00:19:12,319","00:19:15,754","Your father didn't love
me when we married.
"
2,10,292,"00:19:15,789","00:19:19,024","He hardly knew me
or I him.
"
2,10,293,"00:19:20,193","00:19:24,163","Love didn't just
happen to us.
"
2,10,294,"00:19:24,198","00:19:26,834","We built it slowly
over the years,

2,10,295,"00:19:26,868","00:19:28,903","stone by stone,
"
2,10,296,"00:19:28,937","00:19:31,306","for you, for your
brothers and sisters,

2,10,297,"00:19:31,340","00:19:33,908","for all of us.
"
2,10,298,"00:19:33,942","00:19:37,978","It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,
"
2,10,299,"00:19:38,013","00:19:40,915","but it is stronger.
"
2,10,300,"00:19:40,949","00:19:43,818","It lasts longer.
"
2,10,301,"00:19:43,853","00:19:46,187","And that is what
would be in store for me
"
2,10,302,"00:19:46,221","00:19:48,056","with one of
Walder Frey's daughters,
"
2,10,303,"00:19:48,091","00:19:50,826","- what you and father had?
- Why not?
"
2,10,304,"00:19:50,860","00:19:52,628","Because she's not beautiful?

2,10,305,"00:19:52,662","00:19:54,664","Because she's not exotic
and exciting?
"
2,10,306,"00:19:54,698","00:19:57,801","Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.
"
2,10,307,"00:19:57,835","00:20:00,671","And you agreed to it.
"
2,10,308,"00:20:00,705","00:20:02,573","You gave him your word.

2,10,309,"00:20:02,607","00:20:07,479","Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

2,10,312,"00:20:11,584","00:20:13,491","And the only parent
I have left has no right

2,10,314,"00:20:35,739","00:20:38,474","You said you saw

2,10,316,"00:20:40,577","00:20:43,212","- I still see it.
- The flames lied.
"
2,10,317,"00:20:44,281","00:20:47,316","And I'm no better
than a savage
"
2,10,318,"00:20:47,351","00:20:49,452","trusting in a Fire God.
"
2,10,319,"00:20:51,521","00:20:54,523","I fought for your God

crushed our rebellion
"
2,10,385,"00:25:30,366","00:25:33,101","and killed my brothers.

3,1,61,"00:09:04,111","00:09:05,779","Did you hear that?
"
3,1,62,"00:09:05,813","00:09:08,882","From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.
"
3,1,63,"00:09:08,916","00:09:12,318","Stand, boy.
"
3,1,64,"00:09:14,455","00:09:17,457","We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.
"
3,1,65,"00:09:20,194","00:09:25,332","So, you're
Ned Stark's bastard.
"
3,1,66,"00:09:25,366","00:09:27,500","Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.
"
3,1,67,"00:09:27,535","00:09:30,204","You can leave us.
"
3,1,68,"00:09:38,713","00:09:40,514","The girl likes you.
"
3,1,69,"00:09:40,548","00:09:42,716","You like her back, Snow?
"
3,1,70,"00:09:42,751","00:09:45,119","That why you want
to join us?
"
3,1,71,"00:09:45,153","00:09:46,921","<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>
"
3,1,72,"00:09:46,956","00:09:49,157","This isn't the damned
Night's Watch
"
3,1,73,"00:09:49,192","00:09:51,393","where we make you
swear off girls.
"
3,1,74,"00:09:51,427","00:09:55,096","This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

3,1,75,"00:09:55,131","00:09:57,566","Can't believe this pup
"
3,1,76,"00:09:57,600","00:09:59,901","<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>
"
3,1,77,"00:09:59,935","00:10:02,136","He was our enemy
"
3,1,78,"00:10:02,171","00:10:05,039","and I'm glad he's dead.
"
3,1,79,"00:10:14,815","00:10:17,517","He was my brother once.
"
3,1,80,"00:10:17,552","00:10:20,220","Back when he had
a whole hand.
"
3,1,81,"00:10:21,789","00:10:23,757","What were you
doing with him?
"
3,1,82,"00:10:23,791","00:10:27,094","The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.
"
3,1,83,"00:10:27,128","00:10:28,962","Why?
"
3,1,84,"00:10:28,996","00:10:30,764","He wants me to lead
one day.
"
3,1,85,"00:10:30,798","00:10:34,268","But here you are,
a traitor
"
3,1,86,"00:10:34,302","00:10:36,770","kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.
"
3,1,87,"00:10:36,838","00:10:40,374","If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.
"
3,1,88,"00:10:47,649","00:10:50,985","Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?
"
3,1,89,"00:10:56,958","00:10:58,926","I want to be free.
"
3,1,90,"00:10:58,960","00:11:02,096","No, I don't think so.
"
3,1,91,"00:11:03,365","00:11:05,299","I think what you want
most of all
"
3,1,92,"00:11:05,333","00:11:07,534","is to be a hero.
"
3,1,93,"00:11:07,569","00:11:11,472","I'll ask you
one last time--
"
3,1,94,"00:11:11,539","00:11:14,541","why do you want
to join us?
"
3,1,95,"00:11:18,980","00:11:22,582","We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.
"
3,1,96,"00:11:24,052","00:11:26,486","I saw...
"
3,1,97,"00:11:26,520","00:11:28,087","You saw what?
"
3,1,98,"00:11:30,391","00:11:32,458","I saw Craster take
his own baby boy
"
3,1,99,"00:11:32,492","00:11:35,227","and leave it
in the woods.
"
3,1,100,"00:11:35,261","00:11:37,529","I saw what took it.
"
3,1,101,"00:11:41,068","00:11:45,171","You're telling me
you saw one of them?
"
3,1,102,"00:11:48,009","00:11:50,511","And why would that make you
desert your brothers?
"
3,1,103,"00:11:50,545","00:11:53,614","Because when I told
the Lord Commander,
"
3,1,104,"00:11:53,648","00:11:55,649","he already knew.
"
3,1,105,"00:11:57,618","00:12:00,254","Thousands of years ago,
the First Men
"
3,1,106,"00:12:00,288","00:12:03,624","battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.
"
3,1,107,"00:12:03,658","00:12:07,628","I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.
"
3,1,108,"00:12:10,698","00:12:12,900","Did I come
to the right place?
"
3,1,109,"00:12:17,672","00:12:20,440","We'll need to find you
a new cloak.
"
3,1,110,"00:12:41,563","00:12:43,764","What if you took off
that bit there?
"
3,1,111,"00:12:45,901","00:12:49,503","Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?
"
3,1,112,"00:12:49,537","00:12:53,439","Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.
"
3,1,113,"00:12:56,009","00:12:58,611","I want you to take it off.
"
3,1,114,"00:13:04,917","00:13:06,785","Mouth.
"
3,1,115,"00:13:12,391","00:13:15,559","Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.
"
3,1,116,"00:13:17,462","00:13:19,430","I didn't hear that.
"
3,1,117,"00:13:19,464","00:13:21,465","- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>
"
3,1,118,"00:13:21,499","00:13:24,435","Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.
"
3,1,119,"00:13:24,469","00:13:28,105","- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.
"
3,1,120,"00:13:28,139","00:13:31,108","I will murder you, boy.
"
3,1,121,"00:13:31,142","00:13:33,610","He said it was a matter
of life and death.
"
3,1,122,"00:13:50,459","00:13:53,628","- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>
"
3,1,123,"00:13:54,898","00:13:57,233","<i>The queen.</i>
"
3,1,124,"00:14:10,014","00:14:11,282","<i>What are they doing here?</i>
"
3,1,125,"00:14:11,316","00:14:14,485","Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?
"
3,1,126,"00:14:15,954","00:14:17,354","No, I don't think so.
"
3,1,127,"00:14:17,389","00:14:19,090","If I wanted to kill you,
do you think
"
3,1,128,"00:14:19,124","00:14:21,792","I'd let a wooden door
stop me?
"
3,1,129,"00:14:27,799","00:14:29,300","They stay outside.
"
3,1,130,"00:14:29,334","00:14:31,569","I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.
"
3,1,131,"00:14:46,585","00:14:49,987","- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.
"
3,1,132,"00:14:50,022","00:14:53,592","They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.
"
3,1,133,"00:14:54,927","00:14:57,062","The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.
"
3,1,134,"00:14:57,096","00:14:59,465","I should hope so.
"
3,1,135,"00:14:59,499","00:15:02,801","The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.
"
3,1,136,"00:15:02,835","00:15:04,903","Thanks to Father.
"
3,1,137,"00:15:04,938","00:15:07,406","Thanks to Father.
"
3,1,138,"00:15:08,908","00:15:11,010","Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.
"
3,1,139,"00:15:11,044","00:15:13,579","No? Curious.
"
3,1,140,"00:15:13,613","00:15:17,416","Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.
"
3,1,141,"00:15:17,450","00:15:19,652","But then I don't suppose
you need much room.
"
3,1,142,"00:15:19,687","00:15:22,655","Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.
"
3,1,143,"00:15:22,689","00:15:25,992","You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

3,1,144,"00:15:26,026","00:15:27,793","You're meeting
Father today?
"
3,1,145,"00:15:27,828","00:15:29,896","How do you know that?
"
3,1,146,"00:15:29,930","00:15:32,766","<i>Because I have hundreds</i>

"
3,1,147,"00:15:32,800","00:15:36,302","The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.
"
3,1,148,"00:15:37,905","00:15:40,940","Father told me.
What do you want from him?
"
3,1,149,"00:15:40,975","00:15:42,608","What do I want from him?
He's my father.
"
3,1,150,"00:15:42,642","00:15:45,144","Do I need
to want something?
"
3,1,151,"00:15:47,713","00:15:49,814","I'm sure
he loves me dearly,
"
3,1,152,"00:15:49,849","00:15:51,549","as any father loves
his child,
"
3,1,153,"00:15:51,584","00:15:54,252","his baby boy.
"
3,1,154,"00:15:54,286","00:15:56,354","Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

3,1,155,"00:15:56,421","00:15:58,022","<i>since arriving</i>

"
3,1,156,"00:15:58,056","00:16:01,158","<i>I lay here,</i>

"
3,1,157,"00:16:01,226","00:16:03,728","but Father never came.
"
3,1,158,"00:16:08,867","00:16:11,301","You're going
to make me cry.
"
3,1,159,"00:16:11,335","00:16:13,703","Why do you care
what I want from him?
"
3,1,160,"00:16:15,172","00:16:17,207","Because you've slandered me
to Father before.
"
3,1,161,"00:16:17,241","00:16:19,475","Slandered?
When?
"
3,1,162,"00:16:19,509","00:16:21,744","<i>You told him</i>

"
3,1,167,"00:16:28,651","00:16:30,685","She lost an eye,

3,1,168,"00:16:30,720","00:16:32,120","If I remember correctly,
"
3,1,169,"00:16:32,154","00:16:34,389","she never stole
a necklace again.
"
3,1,170,"00:16:36,092","00:16:38,994","It's not slander
if it's true.
"
3,1,171,"00:16:39,028","00:16:41,730","And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

"
3,1,174,"00:16:45,801","00:16:47,869","Because you're a liar.

about me, about Joffrey.
"
3,1,176,"00:16:51,007","00:16:53,476","Any lies in particular?

"
3,1,179,"00:16:59,984","00:17:03,020","Still makes me
more clever than you.

3,1,221,"00:20:02,135","00:20:03,435","Who are you?
"
3,1,222,"00:20:05,972","00:20:10,176","I was in the battle
at Blackwater.
"
3,1,223,"00:20:11,445","00:20:15,215","I was a captain
and a knight.
"
3,1,224,"00:20:15,249","00:20:19,119","Aye, ser,
and serving which king?
"
3,1,225,"00:20:24,693","00:20:27,462","The one true king
of Westeros--
"
3,1,226,"00:20:30,099","00:20:32,166","Stannis Baratheon.
"
3,1,227,"00:20:41,709","00:20:43,343","I thought you were dead.
"
3,1,228,"00:20:43,378","00:20:46,012","Everyone thought
you were dead.
"
3,1,229,"00:20:50,317","00:20:51,584","And your son?
"
3,1,230,"00:20:57,357","00:20:59,759","He may have swam
ashore as you did.
"
3,1,231,"00:20:59,793","00:21:02,829","No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.
"
3,1,232,"00:21:12,339","00:21:15,574","I'm so sorry,
my friend.
"
3,1,233,"00:21:15,609","00:21:18,144","I, too, have lost a son.
"
3,1,234,"00:21:18,178","00:21:20,546","There is nothing worse
in this world.
"
3,1,235,"00:21:22,215","00:21:25,450","But, Davos, you were
a good father.
"
3,1,236,"00:21:25,484","00:21:29,020","If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.
"
3,1,237,"00:21:31,990","00:21:33,624","Stannis lives?
"
3,1,238,"00:21:33,658","00:21:35,860","He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

3,1,239,"00:21:35,894","00:21:37,661","Will you take me there?
"
3,1,240,"00:21:37,696","00:21:40,097","There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.
"
3,1,241,"00:21:40,132","00:21:41,598","This war is not over.
"
3,1,242,"00:21:41,633","00:21:42,966","Not for you, maybe.
"
3,1,243,"00:21:43,001","00:21:45,736","But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.
"
3,1,244,"00:21:45,770","00:21:47,771","We're both sworn
to King Stannis.
"
3,1,245,"00:21:47,805","00:21:50,274","I am sworn to no man.
"
3,1,246,"00:21:50,308","00:21:54,111","I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.
"
3,1,247,"00:21:54,145","00:21:55,646","I delivered the ships.
"
3,1,248,"00:21:55,681","00:21:57,849","Stannis never gives up.
Never.
"
3,1,249,"00:21:57,883","00:22:00,285","- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>
"
3,1,250,"00:22:00,319","00:22:02,788","His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.
"
3,1,251,"00:22:02,822","00:22:04,457","They say he sees no one--
"
3,1,252,"00:22:04,491","00:22:06,726","not his generals,
not even his wife.
"
3,1,253,"00:22:06,760","00:22:09,763","Only the Red Woman
"
3,1,254,"00:22:09,797","00:22:11,164","whispering in his ear,
"
3,1,255,"00:22:11,198","00:22:14,033","telling him what
she sees in the flames
"
3,1,256,"00:22:14,068","00:22:15,702","and burning men alive.
"
3,1,257,"00:22:15,736","00:22:17,170","What?
"
3,1,258,"00:22:17,205","00:22:20,707","They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.
"
3,1,259,"00:22:20,741","00:22:23,643","All those who spoke
against her she called
"
3,1,260,"00:22:23,677","00:22:26,279","servants of darkness.
"
3,1,261,"00:22:28,248","00:22:30,783","They say she sang
to them as they burned.
"
3,1,262,"00:22:35,589","00:22:37,090","I'm a pirate.
"
3,1,263,"00:22:37,124","00:22:39,425","<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

3,1,264,"00:22:39,460","00:22:41,127","<i>Servants of darkness.</i>
"
3,1,265,"00:22:41,161","00:22:44,430","I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.
"
3,1,266,"00:22:44,464","00:22:46,731","Take me back there, please.
"
3,1,267,"00:22:46,766","00:22:48,666","You cannot turn
Stannis against her.
"
3,1,268,"00:22:48,701","00:22:51,335","Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.
"
3,1,269,"00:22:51,370","00:22:52,970","You could try.
"
3,1,270,"00:22:53,005","00:22:55,373","If you fail,
they will burn you.
"
3,1,271,"00:22:55,407","00:22:58,276","If you succeed,
they'll burn you.
"
3,1,272,"00:22:58,310","00:23:00,445","And you've only
just come back to life.
"
3,1,273,"00:23:00,479","00:23:02,714","Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.
"
3,1,274,"00:23:02,748","00:23:05,483","You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.
"
3,1,275,"00:23:05,517","00:23:07,985","And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,
"
3,1,276,"00:23:08,020","00:23:09,921","but I don't ask you
for favors.
"
3,1,277,"00:23:09,955","00:23:11,556","I have to stop her.
"
3,1,278,"00:23:11,590","00:23:14,726","Please, do this for me.
"
3,1,279,"00:23:17,564","00:23:19,932","When you are dead,
"
3,1,280,"00:23:19,966","00:23:22,401","I will gather your bones
in a little sack
"
3,1,281,"00:23:22,435","00:23:25,538","and let your widow
wear them around her neck.
"
3,1,282,"00:23:38,486","00:23:41,754","We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.
"
3,1,283,"00:23:41,788","00:23:44,557","There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.
"
3,1,284,"00:23:44,591","00:23:46,092","I imagine the Mountain
will defend

"
3,1,287,"00:23:50,230","00:23:52,932","I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

3,1,288,"00:23:52,967","00:23:55,769","I don't think
we're going to get one.

3,1,317,"00:27:26,388","00:27:28,356","I heard how happy you were.

at the time.
"
3,1,320,"00:27:37,933","00:27:40,868","I sent you here

"
3,1,321,"00:27:40,902","00:27:44,938","I gave you real power

3,1,382,"00:30:54,062","00:30:57,965","that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.
"
3,1,383,"00:30:57,999","00:30:59,700","But neither gods nor men
"
3,1,384,"00:30:59,734","00:31:02,636","will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock
"
3,1,385,"00:31:02,670","00:31:05,772","<i>into your whorehouse.</i>
"
3,1,386,"00:31:05,807","00:31:08,675","Go, now.
"
3,1,387,"00:31:11,846","00:31:15,582","Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.
"
3,1,388,"00:31:17,584","00:31:19,786","Go.
"
3,1,389,"00:31:28,762","00:31:30,896","Oh, one more thing.
"
3,1,390,"00:31:33,233","00:31:36,435","The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.
"
3,1,391,"00:31:44,378","00:31:47,181","<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>
"
3,1,392,"00:31:47,215","00:31:50,117","<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk
"
3,1,393,"00:31:50,152","00:31:53,621","and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.
"
3,1,394,"00:31:57,659","00:31:59,993","But it's not
coming back.
"
3,1,395,"00:32:00,028","00:32:02,629","The captain's tired
of risking his life
"
3,1,396,"00:32:02,664","00:32:04,832","so King's Landing
lords and ladies
"
3,1,397,"00:32:04,866","00:32:07,935","can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.
"
3,1,398,"00:32:09,304","00:32:11,506","He's going
to stay in Dorne.
"
3,1,399,"00:32:11,540","00:32:14,876","Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.
"
3,1,400,"00:32:14,910","00:32:18,680","I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.
"
3,1,401,"00:32:18,715","00:32:20,683","Don't ruin the game.
"
3,1,402,"00:32:20,717","00:32:23,453","I told you,
I don't want to play.
"
3,1,403,"00:32:24,555","00:32:26,589","What about that one there?
"
3,1,404,"00:32:26,624","00:32:28,091","That one?
"
3,1,405,"00:32:28,125","00:32:30,127","It's going to Volantis.
"
3,1,406,"00:32:30,161","00:32:31,595","Why?
"
3,1,407,"00:32:31,629","00:32:33,330","Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,
"
3,1,408,"00:32:33,364","00:32:35,899","it looked like that one.
"
3,1,409,"00:32:35,934","00:32:37,735","That's not how
the game works.
"
3,1,410,"00:32:37,769","00:32:41,339","You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.
"
3,1,411,"00:32:41,373","00:32:42,973","You've got
to invent a story
"
3,1,412,"00:32:43,008","00:32:46,443","about where the ship
is going and why.
"
3,1,413,"00:32:46,478","00:32:49,347","Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?
"
3,1,414,"00:32:49,381","00:32:51,415","Because the truth
"
3,1,415,"00:32:51,450","00:32:53,985","is always either
terrible or boring.
"
3,1,416,"00:32:54,019","00:32:56,788","Lovely day for it.
"
3,1,417,"00:32:56,822","00:32:58,724","Watching the ships.
"
3,1,418,"00:32:58,758","00:33:01,727","Lord Baelish.
"
3,1,419,"00:33:01,762","00:33:04,797","Might I speak
with Lady Sansa
"
3,1,420,"00:33:04,832","00:33:06,466","alone for a moment?
"
3,1,421,"00:33:17,945","00:33:20,813","I saw your mother
not long ago.
"
3,1,422,"00:33:22,215","00:33:24,516","She's very eager
to see you.
"
3,1,423,"00:33:26,286","00:33:29,587","And your sister.
"
3,1,424,"00:33:29,622","00:33:32,224","Arya's alive?
"
3,1,425,"00:33:35,528","00:33:37,395","You said
you'd take me home.
"
3,1,426,"00:33:37,429","00:33:40,798","You said King's Landing
was your home.
"
3,1,427,"00:33:42,000","00:33:43,367","You are the property
of the crown.
"
3,1,428,"00:33:43,401","00:33:44,768","Stealing you
would be treason.
"
3,1,429,"00:33:44,803","00:33:47,037","If you were to tell
just one person--
"
3,1,430,"00:33:47,072","00:33:49,073","- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?
"
3,1,431,"00:33:49,107","00:33:51,041","Because I'm a terrible liar.
"
3,1,432,"00:33:51,075","00:33:53,710","You said so yourself.
"
3,1,433,"00:33:53,744","00:33:56,913","Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.
"
3,1,434,"00:34:00,150","00:34:01,684","I'm waiting for word
on an assignment
"
3,1,435,"00:34:01,718","00:34:04,920","that will take me far away
from the capital.
"
3,1,436,"00:34:04,988","00:34:06,655","When I set sail,
"
3,1,437,"00:34:06,689","00:34:09,224","I might be able
to take you with me.
"
3,1,438,"00:34:09,258","00:34:12,260","But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.
"
3,1,439,"00:34:14,697","00:34:16,965","You're her handmaiden?
"
3,1,440,"00:34:19,001","00:34:21,837","Yes.
And you're his...?
"
3,1,441,"00:34:21,871","00:34:25,341","I help manage
his affairs.
"
3,1,442,"00:34:25,375","00:34:28,778","- He's an important person.
- So is she.
"
3,1,443,"00:34:28,812","00:34:31,346","I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.
"
3,1,444,"00:34:31,381","00:34:33,382","The day she was born,
they rang the bells
"
3,1,445,"00:34:33,416","00:34:35,818","from sunrise till sunset.
"
3,1,446,"00:34:38,188","00:34:40,823","We've both done
rather well, you and I.
"
3,1,447,"00:34:43,394","00:34:45,161","Yes.
"
3,1,448,"00:34:45,195","00:34:48,431","Given where we started.
"
3,1,449,"00:34:48,465","00:34:50,700","And where is that?
"
3,1,450,"00:34:52,169","00:34:54,236","It's not easy
for girls like us
"
3,1,451,"00:34:54,271","00:34:56,439","to dig our way out.
"
3,1,452,"00:35:01,211","00:35:03,812","<i>Watch out for her.</i>
"
3,1,453,"00:35:03,847","00:35:06,681","I always do.
"
3,1,454,"00:35:06,716","00:35:09,417","Watch out for her
with him.
"
3,1,455,"00:36:01,706","00:36:03,808","They're growing fast.
"
3,1,456,"00:36:07,012","00:36:08,545","Not fast enough.
"
3,1,457,"00:36:09,714","00:36:11,983","I can't wait that long.
"
3,1,458,"00:36:15,220","00:36:16,855","I need an army.
"
3,1,459,"00:36:18,224","00:36:20,658","We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.
"
3,1,460,"00:36:22,561","00:36:24,729","Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.
"
3,1,461,"00:36:24,764","00:36:27,566","The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.
"
3,1,462,"00:36:27,600","00:36:29,902","The distinction means
a good deal to some people.
"
3,1,463,"00:36:29,936","00:36:31,770","Do those people
have any better ideas
"
3,1,464,"00:36:31,804","00:36:35,073","about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?
"
3,1,465,"00:36:36,775","00:36:38,610","It's too beautiful
a day to argue.
"
3,1,466,"00:36:42,214","00:36:43,948","You're right.
"
3,1,467,"00:36:46,651","00:36:49,153","Another lovely day
on the high seas.
"
3,1,468,"00:36:49,187","00:36:50,954","<i>Don't mock them.</i>
"
3,1,469,"00:36:50,989","00:36:53,357","They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

3,1,470,"00:36:53,424","00:36:55,759","They followed me
across the poison water.
"
3,1,471,"00:36:55,793","00:36:57,094","If they'll do it,
others will.
"
3,1,472,"00:36:57,128","00:36:58,661","And with a true
khalasar--

3,1,473,"00:36:58,696","00:37:02,799","The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.
"
3,1,474,"00:37:02,834","00:37:06,602","You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.
"
3,1,475,"00:37:06,637","00:37:08,838","And not before.
"
3,1,476,"00:37:36,099","00:37:37,666","Your Grace.
"
3,1,477,"00:37:48,679","00:37:51,248","I heard you were dead.

3,1,478,"00:37:51,282","00:37:53,150","Not yet.
"
3,1,479,"00:37:55,286","00:37:58,155","I had hoped to speak

3,1,483,"00:38:17,343","00:38:20,312","You're an honorable man,
a just man.
"
3,1,484,"00:38:20,346","00:38:22,648","And there is still
a war to fight.
"
3,1,485,"00:38:22,682","00:38:25,383","I am fighting.
"
3,1,486,"00:38:25,418","00:38:28,053","By burning
prisoners alive?
"
3,1,487,"00:38:30,357","00:38:32,124","How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?
"
3,1,488,"00:38:32,159","00:38:34,594","I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.
"
3,1,489,"00:38:34,628","00:38:36,729","If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea
"
3,1,490,"00:38:36,763","00:38:39,498","before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.
"
3,1,491,"00:38:39,599","00:38:42,234","- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.
"
3,1,492,"00:38:46,173","00:38:48,574","Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?
"
3,1,493,"00:38:49,877","00:38:52,378","<i>Did I set</i>

"
3,1,494,"00:38:55,883","00:39:00,020","I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.
"
3,1,495,"00:39:02,023","00:39:04,692","I could have
saved those men.
"
3,1,496,"00:39:04,726","00:39:06,360","You would have
taken the city,
"
3,1,497,"00:39:06,428","00:39:08,269","Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,
"
3,1,498,"00:39:08,297","00:39:09,965","and you would
stand beside him.
"
3,1,499,"00:39:09,999","00:39:12,534","<i>But I wasn't there</i>
"
3,1,500,"00:39:12,568","00:39:16,238","because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.
"
3,1,501,"00:39:24,414","00:39:27,449","Do you hear them screaming?
"
3,1,502,"00:39:27,483","00:39:30,786","All those burning men
in the water

3,1,507,"00:39:48,469","00:39:50,837","What I told

on the walls

"
3,4,79,"00:07:11,395","00:07:13,162","One day in Myr,
"
3,4,80,"00:07:13,196","00:07:16,031","a certain man
made my master an offer
"
3,4,81,"00:07:16,065","00:07:18,133","too tempting to refuse.
"
3,4,82,"00:07:18,167","00:07:20,735","I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard
"
3,4,83,"00:07:20,769","00:07:22,770","some men used small boys.
"
3,4,84,"00:07:22,804","00:07:25,506","But what he wanted
was far worse.
"
3,4,85,"00:07:26,775","00:07:28,175","He gave me a potion
"
3,4,86,"00:07:28,209","00:07:30,310","that made me powerless
to move or speak,
"
3,4,87,"00:07:30,344","00:07:33,346","yet did nothing
to dull my senses.
"
3,4,88,"00:07:33,380","00:07:35,781","With a hooked blade
he sliced me,
"
3,4,89,"00:07:35,816","00:07:38,751","root and stem,
chanting all the while.
"
3,4,90,"00:07:38,785","00:07:42,387","He burned my parts
in a brazier.
"
3,4,91,"00:07:42,422","00:07:43,956","The flames turned blue
"
3,4,92,"00:07:43,990","00:07:47,659","and I heard a voice
answer his call.
"
3,4,93,"00:07:52,564","00:07:56,166","I still dream of that night.
"
3,4,94,"00:07:56,201","00:07:58,635","Not of the sorcerer,
"
3,4,95,"00:07:58,670","00:08:00,937","not of his blade.
"
3,4,96,"00:08:00,972","00:08:03,406","I dream of the voice
from the flames.
"
3,4,97,"00:08:03,441","00:08:05,642","Was it a god?
A demon?
"
3,4,98,"00:08:05,676","00:08:07,344","A conjuror's trick?
"
3,4,99,"00:08:07,378","00:08:09,512","I don't know.
"
3,4,100,"00:08:09,547","00:08:13,016","But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.
"
3,4,101,"00:08:13,050","00:08:15,451","And ever since that day,
"
3,4,102,"00:08:15,486","00:08:19,255","I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.
"
3,4,103,"00:08:19,289","00:08:21,691","But you can see
why I was eager to aid
"
3,4,104,"00:08:21,725","00:08:25,093","in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.
"
3,4,105,"00:08:25,128","00:08:28,830","A symbolic revenge of sorts.
"
3,4,106,"00:08:28,864","00:08:32,900","Yes, ahem. I feel the
need for actual revenge
"
3,4,107,"00:08:32,934","00:08:34,935","against the actual person
"
3,4,108,"00:08:34,969","00:08:37,469","who tried to have me killed.
"
3,4,109,"00:08:37,504","00:08:40,839","Which will require a degree
of influence, which--
"
3,4,110,"00:08:40,873","00:08:43,207","You do not possess
"
3,4,111,"00:08:43,242","00:08:45,943","at the moment.
"
3,4,112,"00:08:45,978","00:08:48,279","But influence is largely
"
3,4,113,"00:08:48,313","00:08:51,448","a matter of patience,
I have found.
"
3,4,114,"00:08:51,482","00:08:54,851","Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,
"
3,4,115,"00:08:54,885","00:08:57,453","he threw me out
of his house to die.
"
3,4,116,"00:08:57,488","00:09:00,223","I resolved to live
"
3,4,117,"00:09:00,257","00:09:01,690","to spite him.
"
3,4,118,"00:09:01,725","00:09:03,258","I begged.
"
3,4,119,"00:09:03,293","00:09:06,494","I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.
"
3,4,120,"00:09:06,528","00:09:08,863","I became an excellent thief
"
3,4,121,"00:09:08,897","00:09:12,265","and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters
"
3,4,122,"00:09:12,300","00:09:16,368","are more valuable than the
contents of his purse.
"
3,4,123,"00:09:16,403","00:09:18,838","Step by step,
"
3,4,124,"00:09:18,872","00:09:21,640","one distasteful task
after another,
"
3,4,125,"00:09:21,674","00:09:25,143","I made my way
from the slums of Myr
"
3,4,126,"00:09:25,178","00:09:28,413","to the small council chamber.
"
3,4,127,"00:09:30,383","00:09:33,284","Influence grows like a weed.
"
3,4,128,"00:09:34,519","00:09:37,054","I tended mine patiently
"
3,4,129,"00:09:37,088","00:09:40,457","until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep
"
3,4,130,"00:09:40,492","00:09:43,827","all the way across
to the far side of the world
"
3,4,131,"00:09:43,861","00:09:47,797","where I managed to wrap
them around something
"
3,4,132,"00:09:47,831","00:09:49,932","very special.
"
3,4,133,"00:09:54,537","00:09:57,605","The sorcerer.
"
3,4,134,"00:09:57,639","00:10:01,074","Hello, my old friend.
"
3,4,135,"00:10:01,108","00:10:04,276","It's been a long time.
"
3,4,136,"00:10:04,311","00:10:07,479","I have no doubt
the revenge you want
"
3,4,137,"00:10:07,514","00:10:09,081","will be yours in time...
"
3,4,138,"00:10:09,115","00:10:12,150","if you have the stomach for it.
"
3,4,139,"00:10:15,154","00:10:17,554","When people talk about
the Night's Watch,
"
3,4,140,"00:10:17,589","00:10:20,023","they never mention
the shoveling.
"
3,4,141,"00:10:20,058","00:10:22,292","Or the shit.
"
3,4,142,"00:10:22,326","00:10:25,027","They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,
"
3,4,143,"00:10:25,061","00:10:26,461","and protecting the realm,
"
3,4,144,"00:10:26,495","00:10:30,831","but shoveling
really is most of it.
"
3,4,145,"00:10:30,866","00:10:34,568","And getting attacked
or killed or worse.
"
3,4,146,"00:10:34,602","00:10:37,070","And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,
"
3,4,147,"00:10:37,104","00:10:38,404","usually you're shoveling.
"
3,4,148,"00:10:38,438","00:10:41,207","Oh, look.
"
3,4,149,"00:10:41,241","00:10:42,975","More shit.
"
3,4,150,"00:10:44,144","00:10:45,910","I was starting
to wonder what to do
"
3,4,151,"00:10:45,945","00:10:47,712","with the rest of my day.
"
3,4,152,"00:10:47,747","00:10:50,081","We need to get out of here.
"
3,4,153,"00:10:51,316","00:10:53,617","When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.
"
3,4,154,"00:10:53,652","00:10:56,586","The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.
"
3,4,155,"00:10:56,621","00:10:59,421","- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.
"
3,4,156,"00:10:59,456","00:11:00,923","We do now.
"
3,4,157,"00:11:00,957","00:11:02,658","We know what's out there.
"
3,4,158,"00:11:02,692","00:11:05,727","Craster's been out here
surviving.
"
3,4,159,"00:11:05,761","00:11:08,363","So he's your new protector now?
"
3,4,160,"00:11:08,397","00:11:09,897","Our good friend Craster?
"
3,4,161,"00:11:09,932","00:11:11,632","We're like the sons
he never had.
"
3,4,162,"00:11:11,667","00:11:14,235","Mormont isn't
gonna save you.
"
3,4,163,"00:11:14,269","00:11:17,605","This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.
"
3,4,164,"00:11:17,639","00:11:18,973","When the walkers come calling,
"
3,4,165,"00:11:19,007","00:11:21,675","Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.
"
3,4,166,"00:11:23,178","00:11:25,044","If we want to live...
"
3,4,167,"00:11:27,247","00:11:29,681","we'll have to look out
for ourselves.
"
3,4,168,"00:11:31,017","00:11:32,984","Shh, shh, shh.
"
3,4,169,"00:11:43,559","00:11:46,661","- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.
"
3,4,170,"00:11:48,997","00:11:51,131","- He's beautiful.
- Shh!
"
3,4,171,"00:11:55,970","00:11:57,704","He's beautiful.
"
3,4,172,"00:11:57,738","00:11:59,772","Does he have a name?
"
3,4,173,"00:11:59,806","00:12:03,408","- No.
- Are you going to give him one?
"
3,4,174,"00:12:03,442","00:12:04,976","Why?
"
3,4,175,"00:12:08,947","00:12:11,114","Here.
"
3,4,176,"00:12:11,149","00:12:13,550","- Gilly. - You said to hold it for you
until you came back.
"
3,4,177,"00:12:13,584","00:12:15,118","- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.
"
3,4,178,"00:12:15,152","00:12:17,119","I don't want
your stupid thimble.
"
3,4,179,"00:12:17,154","00:12:20,422","I want to save
my baby's life.
Can you do that?
"
3,4,180,"00:12:20,457","00:12:22,491","Can you?
"
3,4,181,"00:12:24,327","00:12:26,427","I don't have time for you.
"
3,4,182,"00:12:26,462","00:12:28,762","I don't have time
for anyone but him
"
3,4,183,"00:12:28,797","00:12:31,999","because he doesn't
have much time.
"
3,4,184,"00:12:57,088","00:12:59,422","You have to go after him.
"
3,4,185,"00:12:59,456","00:13:01,324","How?
"
3,4,186,"00:13:01,358","00:13:03,425","You know how.
"
3,4,187,"00:13:26,548","00:13:29,249","Brandon.
"
3,4,188,"00:13:29,283","00:13:32,685","- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?
"
3,4,189,"00:13:32,720","00:13:35,121","- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.
"
3,4,190,"00:13:35,155","00:13:36,889","- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.
"
3,4,191,"00:13:36,923","00:13:38,857","No more climbing.
Promise me.
"
3,4,192,"00:13:38,891","00:13:40,558","Promise me!
Promise me!
"
3,4,193,"00:13:40,592","00:13:42,894","- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!
"
3,4,194,"00:13:42,928","00:13:44,162","Promise me!
"
3,4,195,"00:13:57,542","00:13:59,509","Is he very large?
"
3,4,196,"00:13:59,544","00:14:01,311","No larger than usual,
apparently.
"
3,4,197,"00:14:01,345","00:14:04,380","- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.
"
3,4,198,"00:14:04,414","00:14:07,016","The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.
"
3,4,199,"00:14:07,050","00:14:08,483","And they've had a lot of men.
"
3,4,200,"00:14:08,518","00:14:10,518","We're talking about
the same Podrick?
"
3,4,201,"00:14:10,553","00:14:13,087","The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?
"
3,4,202,"00:14:13,122","00:14:14,689","Seems a bit simple?
"
3,4,203,"00:14:16,291","00:14:17,725","What did he do to them?
"
3,4,204,"00:14:17,759","00:14:19,025","I don't know, my lord.
"
3,4,205,"00:14:19,060","00:14:21,428","The girls are usually
quite descriptive.
"
3,4,206,"00:14:21,462","00:14:23,396","So what did they say?
"
3,4,207,"00:14:23,430","00:14:26,465","They said it was hard
to describe.
"
3,4,208,"00:14:26,500","00:14:28,067","Huh.
"
3,4,209,"00:14:28,101","00:14:32,838","Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.
"
3,4,210,"00:14:32,872","00:14:37,075","And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?
"
3,4,211,"00:14:37,110","00:14:39,177","He was too preoccupied
to notice.
"
3,4,212,"00:14:39,211","00:14:41,512","He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.
"
3,4,213,"00:14:41,546","00:14:43,046","I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.
"
3,4,214,"00:14:43,081","00:14:45,681","Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love
"
3,4,215,"00:14:45,716","00:14:49,218","of the Lady Arryn and the
title that comes with her.
"
3,4,216,"00:14:49,252","00:14:51,353","Sad, really.
"
3,4,217,"00:14:51,387","00:14:53,354","Is that all it takes
"
3,4,218,"00:14:53,388","00:14:56,490","to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?
"
3,4,219,"00:14:57,759","00:15:00,060","He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,
"
3,4,220,"00:15:00,095","00:15:01,895","as far as I know.
"
3,4,221,"00:15:01,929","00:15:04,564","But I don't think
he's lost interest.
"
3,4,222,"00:15:04,598","00:15:06,699","What makes you say so?
"
3,4,223,"00:15:08,402","00:15:11,103","- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.
"
3,4,224,"00:15:12,905","00:15:14,406","You can read.
"
3,4,225,"00:15:14,440","00:15:16,507","Rare for a woman
in your profession.
"
3,4,226,"00:15:16,542","00:15:19,542","- Former profession.
- Of course.
"
3,4,227,"00:15:19,577","00:15:23,145","I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?
"
3,4,228,"00:15:23,180","00:15:25,080","Two featherbeds.
"
3,4,229,"00:15:25,115","00:15:27,649","He's bringing two
featherbeds for the cabin.
"
3,4,230,"00:15:29,452","00:15:31,987","Who is important enough
to Littlefinger
"
3,4,231,"00:15:32,021","00:15:34,823","to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?
"
3,4,232,"00:15:34,857","00:15:37,092","Could he be bringing
one of his girls?
"
3,4,233,"00:15:37,126","00:15:39,427","He's not interested
in them, my lord.
"
3,4,234,"00:15:39,462","00:15:41,196","How do you know?
"
3,4,235,"00:15:41,230","00:15:43,631","Because I'm one of his girls.
"
3,4,236,"00:15:43,665","00:15:47,100","Prodigies in odd places indeed.
"
3,4,237,"00:15:48,469","00:15:51,638","Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,
"
3,4,238,"00:15:51,672","00:15:54,140","or rather his dragon.
"
3,4,239,"00:15:54,174","00:15:56,775","It ate her
while her son watched.
"
3,4,240,"00:15:58,378","00:16:01,647","What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.
"
3,4,241,"00:16:04,417","00:16:07,752","The ceremony is traditionally
held in the main sanctum,
"
3,4,242,"00:16:07,787","00:16:11,022","which seats 700 comfortably.
"
3,4,243,"00:16:11,056","00:16:13,724","There appears to be a
good deal of room elsewhere
"
3,4,244,"00:16:13,758","00:16:16,359","on the premises
for everyone else.
"
3,4,245,"00:16:16,393","00:16:19,562","There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.
"
3,4,246,"00:16:19,596","00:16:22,731","No, the rest are there
to look adoringly
"
3,4,247,"00:16:22,765","00:16:24,799","upon the 700 to remind them
"
3,4,248,"00:16:24,834","00:16:28,003","how superior they must be
to have the best seats.
"
3,4,249,"00:16:28,037","00:16:29,537","Over there in that urn,
"
3,4,250,"00:16:29,572","00:16:31,906","the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.
"
3,4,251,"00:16:31,940","00:16:33,908","Aerion Brightflame
they called him.
"
3,4,252,"00:16:33,942","00:16:37,111","He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.
"
3,4,253,"00:16:37,145","00:16:40,347","He was wrong.
"
3,4,254,"00:16:40,382","00:16:42,416","And, of course,
there's the Mad King,
"
3,4,255,"00:16:42,450","00:16:44,184","killed by my uncle.
"
3,4,256,"00:16:44,219","00:16:47,420","Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?
"
3,4,257,"00:16:47,454","00:16:50,423","Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?
"
3,4,258,"00:16:50,457","00:16:52,191","Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.
"
3,4,259,"00:16:52,225","00:16:54,793","I'd love to see
their tombs, really.
"
3,4,260,"00:16:54,827","00:16:57,129","It's like taking a walk
through history.
"
3,4,261,"00:17:01,100","00:17:03,401","- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.
"
3,4,262,"00:17:03,435","00:17:05,069","You were married
here, Your Grace?
"
3,4,263,"00:17:05,103","00:17:08,271","- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.
"
3,4,264,"00:17:08,305","00:17:10,072","Seems like a lifetime ago.
"
3,4,265,"00:17:10,107","00:17:12,441","Your husband, was he
buried here as well?
"
3,4,266,"00:17:12,475","00:17:15,577","No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.
"
3,4,267,"00:17:15,611","00:17:19,180","- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.
"
3,4,268,"00:17:19,214","00:17:20,748","Hunting and drinking don't mix.
"
3,4,269,"00:17:20,782","00:17:22,350","I should say not.
"
3,4,270,"00:17:22,384","00:17:24,452","My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget
"
3,4,271,"00:17:24,486","00:17:27,354","he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.
"
3,4,272,"00:17:27,389","00:17:30,357","I seem to recall he laid
siege to Storm's End
"
3,4,273,"00:17:30,391","00:17:31,925","for the better part of a year.
"
3,4,274,"00:17:31,959","00:17:33,693","All he laid siege to
"
3,4,275,"00:17:33,728","00:17:36,029","was the banquet table
in the command tent.
"
3,4,276,"00:17:36,063","00:17:39,298","I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.
"
3,4,277,"00:17:39,333","00:17:42,835","He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.
"
3,4,278,"00:17:43,770","00:17:46,304","We mothers do what we can
"
3,4,279,"00:17:46,338","00:17:48,506","to keep our sons
from the grave.
"
3,4,280,"00:17:48,540","00:17:50,541","But they do seem
to yearn for it.
"
3,4,281,"00:17:50,575","00:17:53,309","We shower them with good sense,
"
3,4,282,"00:17:53,344","00:17:56,846","and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.
"
3,4,283,"00:17:57,948","00:17:59,849","And yet the world
belongs to them.
"
3,4,284,"00:17:59,883","00:18:02,785","A ridiculous
arrangement, to my mind.

to make it so.
"
3,4,286,"00:18:10,557","00:18:12,391","My father didn't
want them here.
"
3,4,287,"00:18:12,425","00:18:14,059","He was going to have
their bodies burned
"
3,4,288,"00:18:14,094","00:18:15,760","and thrown in the Blackwater,
"
3,4,289,"00:18:15,795","00:18:19,296","but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.
"
3,4,290,"00:18:19,331","00:18:20,965","I'm glad he did.
"
3,4,291,"00:18:22,901","00:18:24,367","I'm sorry, Your Grace.
"
3,4,292,"00:18:24,402","00:18:26,135","I know they did terrible
things at the end,
"
3,4,293,"00:18:26,170","00:18:30,072","but their ancestors built this.
"
3,4,294,"00:18:32,008","00:18:33,908","Sometimes severity
"
3,4,295,"00:18:33,942","00:18:36,076","is the price we pay
for greatness.
"
3,4,296,"00:18:37,279","00:18:40,414","I couldn't agree more.
"
3,4,297,"00:18:50,024","00:18:52,458","Shall we go and see them?

3,4,298,"00:18:52,492","00:18:54,927","If you give them your love,
"
3,4,299,"00:18:54,962","00:18:58,397","they will return it
a thousandfold.
"
3,4,300,"00:18:58,431","00:19:00,933","I've spoken with them.
"
3,4,301,"00:19:00,967","00:19:03,301","I know how they feel about you.

to Deepwood Motte?
"
3,4,316,"00:20:04,521","00:20:06,088","Not far, my lord.

3,4,317,"00:20:06,122","00:20:08,090","Your sister is waiting
for you there.
"
3,4,318,"00:20:08,124","00:20:09,925","- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.
"
3,4,319,"00:20:09,959","00:20:13,795","I served them, the men
who were torturing you.
"
3,4,320,"00:20:13,829","00:20:16,398","I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.
"
3,4,321,"00:20:16,432","00:20:18,800","Why would you risk
your life for me?
"
3,4,322,"00:20:18,835","00:20:21,836","I grew up on
Saltcliffe, my lord.
"
3,4,323,"00:20:21,871","00:20:25,005","I was only a boy
when they took you away.
"
3,4,324,"00:20:25,040","00:20:27,007","My father brought me and my
brothers up to the bluffs
"
3,4,325,"00:20:27,041","00:20:30,043","so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.
"
3,4,326,"00:20:30,077","00:20:33,112","I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,
"
3,4,327,"00:20:33,146","00:20:35,948","""That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son.""
"
3,4,328,"00:20:37,350","00:20:39,684","And those are the words
I heard over and over again
"
3,4,329,"00:20:39,718","00:20:42,019","when I saw what
they were doing to you.
"
3,4,330,"00:20:42,053","00:20:44,054","Those men,
"
3,4,331,"00:20:44,088","00:20:47,090","they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.
"
3,4,332,"00:20:48,825","00:20:50,993","Did he?
"
3,4,333,"00:20:51,027","00:20:53,963","I-- I don't know,
my lord.
"
3,4,334,"00:20:53,997","00:20:57,466","They-- they never
told me much.
"
3,4,335,"00:21:06,508","00:21:08,075","My sister's men
are loyal to her.
"
3,4,336,"00:21:08,110","00:21:10,277","We don't need
to hide from them.
"
3,4,337,"00:21:10,312","00:21:12,346","Not all those
are your sister's men.
"
3,4,338,"00:21:12,380","00:21:15,081","Some of them are loyal
to your father.
"
3,4,339,"00:21:18,418","00:21:20,418","What is it?
"
3,4,340,"00:21:20,453","00:21:22,053","I was just thinking
how jealous I was
"
3,4,341,"00:21:22,087","00:21:24,222","when my father told Yara
to take this place.
"
3,4,342,"00:21:24,256","00:21:26,023","What did he tell you to do?
"
3,4,343,"00:21:26,058","00:21:28,258","Raid fishing villages.
"
3,4,344,"00:21:28,293","00:21:30,127","He didn't trust me.
"
3,4,345,"00:21:30,161","00:21:31,928","Thought I was a Stark.
"
3,4,346,"00:21:31,963","00:21:34,898","Ha. I could never
be a Stark.
"
3,4,347,"00:21:34,932","00:21:37,400","Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.
"
3,4,348,"00:21:37,434","00:21:39,936","- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.
"
3,4,349,"00:21:39,970","00:21:43,138","All he had to do was be.
"
3,4,350,"00:21:44,241","00:21:47,176","Be who he was born to be.
"
3,4,351,"00:21:47,210","00:21:49,678","His life fit him
better than his clothes.
"
3,4,352,"00:21:49,713","00:21:52,214","How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?
"
3,4,353,"00:21:52,249","00:21:54,516","He's the King in the North.
"
3,4,354,"00:21:54,550","00:21:55,850","And me...
"
3,4,355,"00:21:55,885","00:21:58,552","my father gave me a choice
"
3,4,356,"00:21:58,587","00:22:00,487","and I made it.
"
3,4,357,"00:22:01,956","00:22:03,824","I could never be a Stark.
"
3,4,358,"00:22:03,858","00:22:07,327","But ironborn,
"
3,4,359,"00:22:07,362","00:22:09,997","that's what I was born to be.
"
3,4,360,"00:22:14,836","00:22:17,437","I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.
"
3,4,361,"00:22:24,411","00:22:26,045","I murdered those boys.
"
3,4,362,"00:22:29,182","00:22:30,949","The Stark boys?
"
3,4,363,"00:22:32,452","00:22:34,052","Never found them.
"
3,4,364,"00:22:34,087","00:22:37,722","Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.
"
3,4,365,"00:22:40,525","00:22:43,926","I let Dagmer slit their throats
"
3,4,366,"00:22:43,961","00:22:46,129","and I let him
burn the bodies...
"
3,4,367,"00:22:47,765","00:22:50,566","so I could keep Winterfell...
"
3,4,368,"00:22:52,736","00:22:55,104","and make my father proud.
"
3,4,369,"00:22:56,072","00:22:58,607","Maybe it's not too late.
"
3,4,370,"00:23:01,677","00:23:03,778","It is.
"
3,4,371,"00:23:11,285","00:23:14,820","My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.
"
3,4,372,"00:23:16,990","00:23:18,891","I made a choice...
"
3,4,373,"00:23:21,127","00:23:23,461","and I chose wrong.
"
3,4,374,"00:23:25,964","00:23:28,632","And now I've burned
everything down.
"
3,4,375,"00:23:30,268","00:23:32,669","Not everything, my lord.
"
3,4,376,"00:23:35,505","00:23:36,805","She's up here.
"
3,4,377,"00:23:49,650","00:23:51,717","- Yara.
- Shh.
"
3,4,378,"00:23:51,752","00:23:53,286","Wait.
"
3,4,379,"00:24:01,961","00:24:04,396","I brought him back.
He killed the others.
"
3,4,380,"00:24:04,430","00:24:06,264","What?
No, I didn't.
"
3,4,381,"00:24:06,298","00:24:08,466","You can't!
"
3,4,382,"00:24:08,500","00:24:11,202","No, please stop!
"
3,4,383,"00:24:13,905","00:24:16,539","No!
"
3,4,384,"00:24:16,573","00:24:18,340","Put him back where he belongs.
"
3,4,385,"00:24:42,896","00:24:44,296","Eat.
"
3,4,386,"00:24:48,234","00:24:49,834","What are you doing?
"
3,4,387,"00:24:50,703","00:24:52,470","I'm dying.
"
3,4,388,"00:24:52,504","00:24:55,472","You can't die.
"
3,4,389,"00:24:55,507","00:24:57,808","You need to live
"
3,4,390,"00:24:57,842","00:25:00,310","to take revenge.
"
3,4,391,"00:25:00,344","00:25:02,811","I don't care about revenge.
"
3,4,392,"00:25:02,846","00:25:04,813","You coward.
"
3,4,393,"00:25:06,148","00:25:08,749","A little misfortune
and you're giving up.
"
3,4,394,"00:25:10,318","00:25:12,352","Misfor--

3,4,395,"00:25:12,387","00:25:13,954","misfortune?
"
3,4,396,"00:25:13,988","00:25:15,755","You lost your hand.
"
3,4,397,"00:25:15,790","00:25:18,524","My sword hand.
I was that hand.
"
3,4,398,"00:25:20,594","00:25:23,095","You have a taste--

3,4,399,"00:25:23,129","00:25:25,830","one taste of the real world
"
3,4,400,"00:25:25,865","00:25:28,967","where people have important
things taken from them
"
3,4,401,"00:25:29,001","00:25:31,769","and you whine and cry and quit.
"
3,4,402,"00:25:31,803","00:25:34,271","You sound like a bloody woman.
"
3,4,403,"00:25:59,961","00:26:02,295","I know what you did for me.
"
3,4,404,"00:26:03,564","00:26:06,566","You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.
"
3,4,405,"00:26:10,570","00:26:12,537","It's called the Sapphire Isle
"
3,4,406,"00:26:12,572","00:26:14,740","because of the blue
of its water.

3,4,451,"00:29:27,207","00:29:30,075","Another golden rose.
How original.
"
3,4,452,"00:29:30,110","00:29:32,511","I eat from plates
stamped with roses.
"
3,4,453,"00:29:32,545","00:29:34,746","I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.
"
3,4,454,"00:29:34,781","00:29:37,649","I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,
"
3,4,455,"00:29:37,683","00:29:40,084","as if that makes it
smell any better.
"
3,4,456,"00:29:40,119","00:29:41,786","Roses are boring, dear.
"
3,4,457,"00:29:41,820","00:29:44,355","""Growing strong.""
"
3,4,458,"00:29:44,389","00:29:47,490","Ha! The dullest words
of any house.
"
3,4,459,"00:29:47,525","00:29:49,425","""Winter is coming!""
"
3,4,460,"00:29:49,459","00:29:51,494","Now that's memorable.
"
3,4,461,"00:29:51,528","00:29:54,596","""We do not sow.""
Strong. Strong.
"
3,4,462,"00:29:54,631","00:29:56,665","Those are houses
you watch out for.
"
3,4,463,"00:29:56,699","00:30:00,835","Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.
"
3,4,464,"00:30:00,869","00:30:02,870","But a golden rose
growing strong--
"
3,4,465,"00:30:02,904","00:30:06,273","ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.
"
3,4,466,"00:30:07,508","00:30:10,743","Look, little loves.
"
3,4,467,"00:30:10,778","00:30:12,678","A spider in the garden.
"
3,4,468,"00:30:13,814","00:30:15,514","Run along now.
"
3,4,469,"00:30:15,549","00:30:17,483","Grow strong.
"
3,4,470,"00:30:19,519","00:30:21,052","My lady.
"
3,4,471,"00:30:21,087","00:30:24,422","I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.
"
3,4,472,"00:30:24,456","00:30:26,924","The city has been made
brighter by your presence.
"
3,4,473,"00:30:26,959","00:30:30,027","The city is made brighter
by my presence?
"
3,4,474,"00:30:30,061","00:30:32,429","Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?
"
3,4,475,"00:30:32,463","00:30:34,030","Are you here to seduce me?
"
3,4,476,"00:30:34,065","00:30:35,732","A little obvious, perhaps.
"
3,4,477,"00:30:35,767","00:30:37,667","Oh, no, please.
"
3,4,478,"00:30:37,701","00:30:41,070","Seduce away.
It's been so long.
"
3,4,479,"00:30:41,105","00:30:43,472","Though I rather think
it's all for naught.
"
3,4,480,"00:30:43,506","00:30:47,142","What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?
"
3,4,481,"00:30:48,344","00:30:50,445","A question for
the philosophers.
"
3,4,482,"00:30:50,479","00:30:53,514","But you've come mincing
all this way for something.
"
3,4,483,"00:30:53,548","00:30:55,682","- So?
- Might I sit?
"
3,4,484,"00:30:55,716","00:30:57,617","No.
"
3,4,485,"00:30:57,651","00:31:00,819","Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.
"
3,4,486,"00:31:00,854","00:31:03,555","I'm curious why
you've sought me out.
"
3,4,487,"00:31:04,757","00:31:07,325","You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.
"
3,4,488,"00:31:07,359","00:31:08,492","Have I?
"
3,4,489,"00:31:08,527","00:31:10,394","Because I spoke to her
once in this garden
"
3,4,490,"00:31:10,428","00:31:13,330","and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?
"
3,4,491,"00:31:13,365","00:31:14,665","Why shouldn't I take
an interest?
"
3,4,492,"00:31:14,699","00:31:16,466","- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?
"
3,4,493,"00:31:16,501","00:31:18,301","No, not particularly.
"
3,4,494,"00:31:18,335","00:31:20,370","But she's had
an interesting childhood.
"
3,4,495,"00:31:20,404","00:31:23,172","She has, sadly.
"
3,4,496,"00:31:23,206","00:31:25,507","Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.
"
3,4,497,"00:31:25,541","00:31:28,876","I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.
"
3,4,498,"00:31:28,911","00:31:30,377","Come, come.
"
3,4,499,"00:31:30,411","00:31:32,979","You surrender rather easily.
"
3,4,500,"00:31:34,482","00:31:35,849","Walk with me.
"
3,4,501,"00:31:35,883","00:31:37,617","I know the walls have ears,
"
3,4,502,"00:31:37,651","00:31:39,986","but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.
"
3,4,503,"00:31:40,020","00:31:42,822","I choose my allies carefully
"
3,4,504,"00:31:42,856","00:31:45,824","and my enemies
more carefully still.
"
3,4,505,"00:31:45,858","00:31:47,759","Which is Sansa Stark?
"
3,4,506,"00:31:47,793","00:31:50,595","Neither.
A babe in the woods.
"
3,4,507,"00:31:50,629","00:31:52,830","- I admired her father.
- Yes.
"
3,4,508,"00:31:52,865","00:31:54,965","Ned Stark had many admirers,
"
3,4,509,"00:31:55,000","00:31:56,433","and how many stepped forward
"
3,4,510,"00:31:56,467","00:31:59,035","when the executioner
came for his head?
"
3,4,511,"00:31:59,070","00:32:00,636","I could not help Lord Stark.
"
3,4,512,"00:32:00,671","00:32:03,906","- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?
"
3,4,513,"00:32:03,940","00:32:07,409","You're not the only one who
has taken an interest in her.
"
3,4,514,"00:32:07,443","00:32:09,210","That's hardly surprising.
"
3,4,515,"00:32:09,245","00:32:11,579","She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.
"
3,4,516,"00:32:11,613","00:32:15,149","Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.
"
3,4,517,"00:32:15,184","00:32:18,051","It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.
"
3,4,518,"00:32:18,086","00:32:20,720","Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.
"
3,4,519,"00:32:20,754","00:32:22,755","A confidant of mine has told me
"
3,4,520,"00:32:22,789","00:32:25,690","that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.
"
3,4,521,"00:32:25,725","00:32:28,026","And why have you come
to me with this matter?
"
3,4,522,"00:32:28,060","00:32:31,863","Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.
"
3,4,523,"00:32:31,897","00:32:33,631","He has acquired the first two.
"
3,4,524,"00:32:33,665","00:32:35,399","How long before
he has the army?
"
3,4,525,"00:32:35,434","00:32:37,534","Perhaps you'll laugh,
"
3,4,526,"00:32:37,569","00:32:39,602","but I know him better than most
"
3,4,527,"00:32:39,637","00:32:41,838","and this is the truth.
"
3,4,528,"00:32:41,872","00:32:46,476","Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.
"
3,4,529,"00:32:46,510","00:32:48,878","If Robb Stark falls,
"
3,4,530,"00:32:48,912","00:32:51,313","Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.
"
3,4,531,"00:32:51,347","00:32:54,315","And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.
"
3,4,532,"00:32:54,349","00:32:56,117","Which seems such a shame.
"
3,4,533,"00:32:56,151","00:32:58,252","Why should a man
with such a low reputation
"
3,4,534,"00:32:58,286","00:33:00,254","steal away such a lovely bride?
"
3,4,535,"00:33:00,288","00:33:02,355","You must despise him.
"
3,4,536,"00:33:02,390","00:33:04,523","You're working so hard
to undermine him.
"
3,4,537,"00:33:04,558","00:33:07,492","Actually, I rather enjoy him.
"
3,4,538,"00:33:07,527","00:33:09,627","But he would see
this country burn
"
3,4,539,"00:33:09,662","00:33:12,062","if he could be
king of the ashes.
"
3,4,540,"00:33:12,097","00:33:14,131","You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.
"
3,4,541,"00:33:14,166","00:33:15,699","You are too kind.
"
3,4,542,"00:33:15,733","00:33:18,668","I believe I have
a possible solution.
"
3,4,543,"00:33:18,702","00:33:20,470","One doesn't need
to be clever for that.
"
3,4,544,"00:33:20,504","00:33:22,071","It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?
"
3,4,545,"00:33:33,515","00:33:35,248","Ahem.
"
3,4,546,"00:33:35,283","00:33:37,316","I didn't mean to disturb you.
"
3,4,547,"00:33:37,351","00:33:39,084","You haven't.
"
3,4,548,"00:33:39,119","00:33:40,886","We'd like some privacy, please.
"
3,4,549,"00:33:40,920","00:33:43,121","If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.
"
3,4,550,"00:33:45,690","00:33:47,558","Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,
"
3,4,551,"00:33:47,592","00:33:50,494","I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.
"
3,4,552,"00:33:54,498","00:33:56,199","What did you pray for?
"
3,4,553,"00:33:56,233","00:33:58,868","- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
"
3,4,554,"00:33:58,902","00:34:01,603","I'll tell you what I prayed
for in the sept this morning.
"
3,4,555,"00:34:01,638","00:34:05,440","Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,
"
3,4,556,"00:34:05,474","00:34:08,709","for an end to the war,
for a short winter.
"
3,4,557,"00:34:08,744","00:34:11,378","Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.
"
3,4,558,"00:34:11,412","00:34:15,214","- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.
"
3,4,559,"00:34:15,248","00:34:16,816","My cousin Alanna
"
3,4,560,"00:34:16,850","00:34:19,385","was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.
"
3,4,561,"00:34:19,419","00:34:21,553","When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees
"
3,4,562,"00:34:21,588","00:34:24,055","and Alanna looked like a
goddess sent to torture me.
"
3,4,563,"00:34:24,090","00:34:25,890","Pig-face, she called me.
"
3,4,564,"00:34:25,925","00:34:27,792","Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.
"
3,4,565,"00:34:27,826","00:34:30,061","I think it had something
to do with my nose.
"
3,4,566,"00:34:30,095","00:34:32,496","Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.
"
3,4,567,"00:34:35,567","00:34:38,368","So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.
"
3,4,568,"00:34:38,403","00:34:40,837","A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.
"
3,4,569,"00:34:40,871","00:34:43,472","- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?
"
3,4,570,"00:34:43,507","00:34:45,908","Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats
"
3,4,571,"00:34:45,942","00:34:48,743","and eventually your face slides
off and you die in agony.
"
3,4,572,"00:34:48,777","00:34:50,678","But that's awful.
"
3,4,573,"00:34:52,881","00:34:55,416","You're--
"
3,4,574,"00:34:55,450","00:34:57,418","I believed you!
"
3,4,575,"00:34:57,452","00:34:59,353","Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.
"
3,4,576,"00:34:59,387","00:35:01,588","Don't say that.
No, you're not.
"
3,4,577,"00:35:01,623","00:35:04,223","So what happened to Alanna?
"
3,4,578,"00:35:04,257","00:35:06,358","Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman
"
3,4,579,"00:35:06,392","00:35:09,327","and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children
"
3,4,580,"00:35:09,362","00:35:11,162","and live in a castle
by the sea.
"
3,4,581,"00:35:11,196","00:35:13,798","It's all terribly frustrating.
"
3,4,582,"00:35:13,832","00:35:16,534","I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.
"
3,4,583,"00:35:16,568","00:35:18,835","You'll be married
here in the capital
"
3,4,584,"00:35:18,870","00:35:22,538","and she'll have to come watch and
pretend to be happy that you're queen.
"
3,4,585,"00:35:25,342","00:35:29,111","I want us to be friends,
good friends.
"
3,4,586,"00:35:29,146","00:35:31,346","That would make me very happy.
"
3,4,587,"00:35:32,981","00:35:34,815","You must see Highgarden.
"
3,4,588,"00:35:34,850","00:35:36,884","You'd love it there.
I know you would.
"
3,4,589,"00:35:36,918","00:35:39,819","We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.
"
3,4,590,"00:35:39,854","00:35:41,287","You should see the costumes.
"
3,4,591,"00:35:41,322","00:35:43,023","People work on them for months.
"
3,4,592,"00:35:44,191","00:35:46,492","I-- I don't think
the queen
"
3,4,593,"00:35:46,526","00:35:48,027","would let me leave
King's Landing.
"
3,4,594,"00:35:48,061","00:35:49,861","The Queen Regent, you mean.
"
3,4,595,"00:35:49,896","00:35:52,263","Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.
"
3,4,596,"00:35:54,066","00:35:58,369","And if you were
to marry Loras...
"
3,4,597,"00:36:00,772","00:36:04,574","Oh, your place would be at
Highgarden, wouldn't it?
"
3,4,598,"00:36:05,609","00:36:07,977","We would be sisters, you and I.
"
3,4,599,"00:36:08,012","00:36:09,945","Would you like that?
"
3,4,600,"00:36:23,792","00:36:26,426","His name was Bannen.
"
3,4,601,"00:36:26,460","00:36:28,161","He was a good man,
"
3,4,602,"00:36:28,195","00:36:30,130","a good ranger.
"
3,4,603,"00:36:30,164","00:36:32,298","He came to us from--
"
3,4,604,"00:36:33,867","00:36:35,935","where did he come from?
"
3,4,605,"00:36:35,969","00:36:38,704","Down White Harbor way.
"
3,4,606,"00:36:38,738","00:36:40,872","He came to us
from White Harbor.
"
3,4,607,"00:36:40,907","00:36:43,941","Never failed in his duty.
"
3,4,608,"00:36:43,975","00:36:47,077","He kept his vows
the best he could.
"
3,4,609,"00:36:47,111","00:36:51,014","He rode far, fought fiercely.
"
3,4,610,"00:36:53,117","00:36:55,551","We shall never see
his like again.
"
3,4,611,"00:36:55,586","00:36:59,021","And now his
watch has ended.
"
3,4,612,"00:37:00,289","00:37:02,824","And now his watch has ended.
"
3,4,613,"00:37:07,162","00:37:10,430","Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.
"
3,4,614,"00:37:10,464","00:37:13,332","It wasn't his foot
that killed him.
"
3,4,615,"00:37:13,367","00:37:16,035","That bastard Craster
starved him to death.
"
3,4,616,"00:37:16,069","00:37:17,870","Craster's got
his daughters to feed.
"
3,4,617,"00:37:17,904","00:37:19,304","You on his side?
"
3,4,618,"00:37:19,338","00:37:22,407","We can't just show up
and steal all his food.
"
3,4,619,"00:37:22,441","00:37:25,076","We're brothers of the
Night's Watch, not thieves.
"
3,4,620,"00:37:25,110","00:37:26,911","The day we leave,
"
3,4,621,"00:37:26,978","00:37:30,547","Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine
"
3,4,622,"00:37:30,582","00:37:33,718","and sit down to a feast
of ham and potatoes
"
3,4,623,"00:37:33,752","00:37:35,720","and laugh at us
"
3,4,624,"00:37:35,754","00:37:37,989","starving in the snow.
"
3,4,625,"00:37:40,758","00:37:42,693","He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.
"
3,4,626,"00:37:45,430","00:37:48,731","Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.
"
3,4,627,"00:37:59,308","00:38:02,877","You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?
"
3,4,628,"00:38:04,446","00:38:06,646","I had my 99th.
"
3,4,629,"00:38:07,849","00:38:10,817","You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?
"
3,4,630,"00:38:12,586","00:38:16,088","And more daughters
than I can count.
"
3,4,631,"00:38:16,123","00:38:18,523","- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?
"
3,4,632,"00:38:18,558","00:38:22,227","Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.
"
3,4,633,"00:38:22,261","00:38:24,329","As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.
"
3,4,634,"00:38:24,363","00:38:26,297","Ah.
"
3,4,635,"00:38:26,331","00:38:28,432","They're as strong
as they're gonna get.
"
3,4,636,"00:38:30,334","00:38:31,735","Them that's dying,
"
3,4,637,"00:38:31,769","00:38:33,870","why don't you cut their
throats and be done with it?
"
3,4,638,"00:38:33,904","00:38:35,872","Hmm?
"
3,4,639,"00:38:35,906","00:38:39,107","Or leave them
if you've not the stomach
"
3,4,640,"00:38:39,142","00:38:40,675","and I'll sort them myself.
"
3,4,641,"00:38:42,011","00:38:44,879","Whose throat you
gonna cut, old man?
"
3,4,642,"00:38:48,316","00:38:49,650","Wait outside.
"
3,4,643,"00:38:49,684","00:38:53,086","It's cold outside and
there's nothing to eat.
"
3,4,644,"00:38:53,121","00:38:54,621","My wives gave you bread.
"
3,4,645,"00:38:54,655","00:38:57,891","There's sawdust in the bread.
"
3,4,646,"00:38:57,925","00:38:59,459","You don't like it,
"
3,4,647,"00:38:59,493","00:39:01,861","you go out there
and eat the snow.
"
3,4,648,"00:39:06,766","00:39:10,601","I'd rather eat what
you've got hidden away.
"
3,4,649,"00:39:12,704","00:39:15,671","I told you to wait outside.
"
3,4,650,"00:39:15,706","00:39:17,539","He's sitting there
drinking our wine,
"
3,4,651,"00:39:17,574","00:39:19,274","eating his fill while we die.
"
3,4,652,"00:39:20,443","00:39:22,944","I gave you crows enough.
"
3,4,653,"00:39:22,978","00:39:24,245","I've got to feed my women!
"
3,4,654,"00:39:24,279","00:39:26,179","So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?
"
3,4,655,"00:39:26,214","00:39:27,694","How else'd you make it
through winter?
"
3,4,656,"00:39:27,715","00:39:30,718","Enough!
Out!
"
3,4,657,"00:39:30,752","00:39:32,620","I am a godly man.
"
3,4,658,"00:39:32,654","00:39:34,154","You're a stingy bastard!
"
3,4,659,"00:39:34,188","00:39:35,555","Bastard?
"
3,4,660,"00:39:35,590","00:39:39,092","Out with you, you little thief.
"
3,4,661,"00:39:39,126","00:39:42,495","And you!
And you!
"
3,4,662,"00:39:44,231","00:39:46,765","Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.
"
3,4,663,"00:39:49,135","00:39:50,902","I'll chop the hands
off the next man
"
3,4,664,"00:39:50,937","00:39:53,271","who calls me bastard.
"
3,4,665,"00:40:08,351","00:40:09,985","You are a bastard.
"
3,4,666,"00:40:12,654","00:40:16,156","A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.
"
3,4,667,"00:40:24,031","00:40:25,965","The gods will
curse us for this.
"
3,4,668,"00:40:26,000","00:40:29,334","- By all the laws--
- There are no laws beyond the Wall.
"
3,4,669,"00:40:29,369","00:40:30,902","Now show us where
he hides the food
"
3,4,670,"00:40:30,937","00:40:33,037","or you'll get
the same as he did.
"
3,4,671,"00:40:33,072","00:40:35,473","Unhand her.
"
3,4,672,"00:40:35,507","00:40:37,374","I shall have your head for this.
"
3,4,673,"00:41:28,820","00:41:31,188","- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?
"
3,4,674,"00:41:31,222","00:41:34,790","- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!
"
3,4,675,"00:41:40,062","00:41:42,496","Follow me.
I know the best way.
"
3,4,676,"00:41:44,332","00:41:46,233","Come on.
"
3,4,677,"00:41:51,872","00:41:53,806","Run fast, Piggy,
"
3,4,678,"00:41:53,840","00:41:56,141","and sleep well!
"
3,4,679,"00:41:56,176","00:41:59,111","I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.
"
3,4,680,"00:42:04,416","00:42:05,949","Can I take
this hood off yet?
"
3,4,681,"00:42:05,984","00:42:07,717","I do apologize, little lady,
"
3,4,682,"00:42:07,752","00:42:10,453","but it's better for you if you
don't see where we're going.
"
3,4,683,"00:42:12,556","00:42:14,623","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3,4,684,"00:42:15,825","00:42:17,959","Halt!
"
3,4,685,"00:42:23,397","00:42:25,865","- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.
"
3,4,686,"00:42:26,734","00:42:28,401","Ugh!
"
3,4,687,"00:42:28,435","00:42:30,703","Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.
"
3,4,688,"00:42:30,737","00:42:32,604","I'd have some.
"
3,4,689,"00:42:36,175","00:42:37,608","Let's go home.
"
3,4,690,"00:42:54,623","00:42:56,390","What is this place?
"
3,4,691,"00:42:56,424","00:42:59,526","Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.
"
3,4,692,"00:43:08,501","00:43:11,303","You look like
a bunch of swineherds.
"
3,4,693,"00:43:11,337","00:43:13,372","Some of us
were swineherds.
"
3,4,694,"00:43:13,406","00:43:16,074","And some of us tanners
and masons.
"
3,4,695,"00:43:16,108","00:43:17,475","That was before.
"
3,4,696,"00:43:17,510","00:43:19,444","You're still swineherds
"
3,4,697,"00:43:19,478","00:43:22,380","and tanners and masons.
"
3,4,698,"00:43:22,415","00:43:25,416","You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

3,4,699,"00:43:25,451","00:43:28,652","No.
"
3,4,700,"00:43:28,686","00:43:31,988","Fighting in a war

fighting in a war.

3,4,708,"00:43:47,569","00:43:49,870","Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

1,000 miles from home.

3,4,712,"00:43:57,645","00:44:01,347","What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

3,5,133,"00:11:52,490","00:11:55,091","He came trading
with his brothers.
"
3,5,134,"00:11:55,126","00:11:58,294","He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.
"
3,5,135,"00:11:58,329","00:12:00,229","But...
"
3,5,136,"00:12:00,297","00:12:02,765","he was weak.
"
3,5,137,"00:12:02,800","00:12:04,500","Not like you.
"
3,5,138,"00:12:04,535","00:12:06,469","That was the first one.
"
3,5,139,"00:12:06,504","00:12:08,472","Then there was
this Thenn boy.
"
3,5,140,"00:12:08,506","00:12:11,942","Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.
"

I think I've heard enough.
"
3,5,142,"00:12:17,916","00:12:19,783","We'd best get back.

3,5,147,"00:12:54,919","00:12:57,521","Let's stay here
a while longer.

3,5,148,"00:12:59,924","00:13:03,193","I don't ever want
to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

3,5,157,"00:13:29,655","00:13:31,255","I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

3,5,206,"00:16:41,549","00:16:43,750","With any luck,

best interests at heart.
"
3,5,217,"00:17:39,941","00:17:44,411","I see. And have you shared these

find them a hindrance.
"
3,5,220,"00:17:50,118","00:17:53,220","And he appreciates those
who aid his family, as you well know.
"
3,5,221,"00:17:53,255","00:17:54,789","He's almost as generous
to those who help us
"
3,5,222,"00:17:54,823","00:17:58,025","as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.
"

relationship with the Tyrells.

- Thank you.

3,5,226,"00:18:05,699","00:18:09,168","And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

that it will.
"
3,5,228,"00:18:18,244","00:18:20,578","Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.
"
3,5,229,"00:18:20,613","00:18:22,013","- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.
"
3,5,230,"00:18:22,048","00:18:24,249","Are there any figs?
Fetch some.
"
3,5,231,"00:18:24,283","00:18:26,385","I always take figs
midafternoon.
"
3,5,232,"00:18:26,419","00:18:27,886","They help move the bowels.

3,5,233,"00:18:27,921","00:18:29,988","To what do I owe
this summons?

3,5,234,"00:18:30,023","00:18:32,057","Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.
"
3,5,235,"00:18:32,092","00:18:34,326","I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.
"
3,5,236,"00:18:34,360","00:18:38,130","I climbed all those steps to discuss
financial matters?
"
3,5,237,"00:18:38,164","00:18:39,431","It's the royal wedding.
"
3,5,238,"00:18:39,465","00:18:40,866","I'm told you had a hand

"
3,5,239,"00:18:40,900","00:18:42,067","Naturally.
"
3,5,240,"00:18:42,101","00:18:44,569","It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

3,5,242,"00:18:46,739","00:18:48,406","What good
is the word extravagant
"
3,5,243,"00:18:48,440","00:18:50,842","if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?
"
3,5,244,"00:18:50,876","00:18:52,944","- I understand that.
- Good.
"
3,5,245,"00:18:52,978","00:18:55,446","But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me
"
3,5,246,"00:18:55,480","00:18:57,114","to calculate the cost
for the crown.
"
3,5,247,"00:18:57,149","00:18:59,651","As of now,
it's a huge expense.

3,5,248,"00:18:59,685","00:19:00,818","And?
"
3,5,249,"00:19:00,853","00:19:04,522","And we're at war,

"
3,5,294,"00:20:54,970","00:20:58,473","When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?
"
3,5,295,"00:20:58,507","00:21:00,108","They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.
"
3,5,296,"00:21:00,142","00:21:02,910","The Lannisters wanted to kill me long

"
3,5,298,"00:21:04,913","00:21:06,714","I want to.

3,5,302,"00:21:14,990","00:21:17,992","I've served men
my entire life.
"
3,5,303,"00:21:18,026","00:21:19,827","I served Master Mott
at King's Landing
"
3,5,304,"00:21:19,861","00:21:22,463","and he sold me
to the Watch.
"
3,5,305,"00:21:22,497","00:21:24,098","I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,
"

Your Grace.
"
3,5,324,"00:23:10,607","00:23:12,141","Vengeance.

3,5,433,"00:29:04,530","00:29:07,865","Then the Lannisters caught me

"
3,5,563,"00:37:51,499","00:37:54,934","He burned anyone

3,5,585,"00:39:05,072","00:39:09,442","But he did listen

3,5,587,"00:39:13,581","00:39:16,450","""You can trust

found me.

3,5,620,"00:41:11,199","00:41:13,400","If this is true...
"
3,5,621,"00:41:15,036","00:41:16,904","why didn't you tell anyone?
"
3,5,622,"00:41:18,907","00:41:20,774","Why didn't you tell
Lord Stark?
"
3,5,623,"00:41:20,809","00:41:22,309","Stark?
"
3,5,624,"00:41:22,344","00:41:24,812","You think
"
3,5,625,"00:41:24,846","00:41:28,783","the honorable Ned Stark
"
3,5,626,"00:41:28,817","00:41:32,087","wanted to hear my side?
"
3,5,627,"00:41:32,121","00:41:34,822","He judged me guilty
"
3,5,628,"00:41:34,857","00:41:37,258","the moment
he set eyes on me.
"
3,5,629,"00:41:40,363","00:41:44,199","By what right
does the wolf
"
3,5,630,"00:41:44,233","00:41:46,234","judge the lion?
"
3,5,631,"00:41:47,537","00:41:49,104","- By what right?

3,5,638,"00:42:07,391","00:42:09,859","- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?
"
3,5,639,"00:42:09,894","00:42:12,963","He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.
"
3,5,640,"00:42:12,997","00:42:14,898","He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

3,5,644,"00:42:21,972","00:42:24,540","I am, child.
"
3,5,645,"00:42:24,574","00:42:26,509","I disobeyed my king,
your father,
"
3,5,646,"00:42:26,543","00:42:28,377","and now I'm paying
the price.
"
3,5,647,"00:42:28,412","00:42:30,913","I don't care.
You're my friend.

3,5,648,"00:42:30,948","00:42:32,882","You must get bored
down here.
"
3,5,649,"00:42:32,917","00:42:34,851","I brought you
something to read.
"
3,5,650,"00:42:34,885","00:42:36,720","It's about Aegon
and his dragons.
"
3,5,651,"00:42:36,754","00:42:40,189","Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?
"
3,5,652,"00:42:40,224","00:42:42,025","- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.
"
3,5,653,"00:42:42,026","00:42:44,327","- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.
"
3,5,654,"00:42:44,362","00:42:46,730","It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.
"
3,5,655,"00:42:46,764","00:42:49,633","Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,
"
3,5,656,"00:42:49,667","00:42:51,068","but it's wasted on me.
"
3,5,657,"00:42:51,102","00:42:53,570","Take it.
I have more.
"
3,5,658,"00:42:54,706","00:42:57,307","My lady, I can't read
the words.
"
3,5,659,"00:42:57,342","00:42:59,410","You can't?
"
3,5,660,"00:42:59,444","00:43:02,146","I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.
"
3,5,661,"00:43:02,180","00:43:04,014","- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.
"
3,5,662,"00:43:04,049","00:43:06,183","- Go. We can't.
- Why not?
"
3,5,663,"00:43:06,218","00:43:08,986","What will they do,
lock us in cells?
"
3,5,664,"00:43:15,226","00:43:16,961","I wouldn't know
where to start.
"
3,5,665,"00:43:16,995","00:43:18,729","At the beginning.
"
3,5,666,"00:43:18,763","00:43:20,664","This word is Aegon.
"
3,5,667,"00:43:20,699","00:43:24,802","When you see A, E, and G
together like that,
"
3,5,668,"00:43:24,836","00:43:26,737","it sounds like egg.
"
3,5,669,"00:43:26,771","00:43:28,673","And the title
of the whole book
"
3,5,670,"00:43:28,707","00:43:30,875","is ""An History
of Aegon the Conqueror
"
3,5,671,"00:43:30,909","00:43:33,077","<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros.""</i>
"
3,5,672,"00:43:45,290","00:43:46,924","It was a bitch
of a siege.
"
3,5,673,"00:43:46,959","00:43:49,127","Mm, you were first
through the breach at Pyke?
"
3,5,674,"00:43:49,161","00:43:52,630","The second.
Thoros of Myr went in alone,
"
3,5,675,"00:43:52,664","00:43:54,832","waving that
flaming sword of his.
"
3,5,676,"00:43:54,867","00:43:57,568","Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.
"
3,5,677,"00:43:57,602","00:44:00,538","Robert knighted you
after the battle?
"
3,5,678,"00:44:00,572","00:44:02,440","Proudest moment
of my life.
"
3,5,679,"00:44:02,474","00:44:05,676","One knee in the dust,
the king's sword on my shoulder,
"
3,5,680,"00:44:05,711","00:44:07,011","listening to the words.
"
3,5,681,"00:44:07,045","00:44:10,748","""In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave.""
"
3,5,682,"00:44:10,783","00:44:13,719","All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.
"
3,5,683,"00:44:15,021","00:44:17,656","In full plate metal
for 16 hours.
"
3,5,684,"00:44:17,691","00:44:19,659","Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.
"
3,5,685,"00:44:19,693","00:44:22,896","I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.
"
3,5,686,"00:44:24,732","00:44:26,967","Robert would have
laughed.
"
3,5,687,"00:44:27,001","00:44:29,603","He was a good man,
a great warrior.
"
3,5,688,"00:44:31,439","00:44:33,373","And a terrible king.
"
3,5,689,"00:44:33,408","00:44:36,776","I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.
"
3,5,690,"00:44:36,811","00:44:38,345","- You swore an oath.
- Yes.
"
3,5,691,"00:44:38,379","00:44:40,247","And a man of honor
keeps his vows,
"
3,5,692,"00:44:40,281","00:44:43,683","even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.
"
3,5,693,"00:44:43,718","00:44:46,286","Just once in my life
before it's over,
"
3,5,694,"00:44:46,321","00:44:49,356","I want to know what it's like
to serve with pride,
"
3,5,695,"00:44:49,390","00:44:52,526","to fight for someone
I believe in.
"
3,5,696,"00:44:52,560","00:44:54,327","Do you believe in her?

3,5,697,"00:44:57,164","00:44:58,999","With all my heart.

3,5,708,"00:46:49,446","00:46:52,548","I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

I minded much.

3,5,717,"00:47:12,802","00:47:14,736","Yeah, I imagine
I would, too.

3,5,718,"00:47:14,770","00:47:17,205","Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

to wade through that muck

King Robert's assassins

3,5,734,"00:47:53,076","00:47:54,877","while you were still

3,5,779,"00:50:17,521","00:50:20,723","with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.
"
3,5,780,"00:50:22,159","00:50:24,860","The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

3,5,781,"00:50:25,896","00:50:27,796","Walder Frey.
"
3,5,782,"00:50:36,672","00:50:38,940","He's such
a splendid fighter.
"
3,5,783,"00:50:38,974","00:50:42,310","Do you have any idea
when we might...
"
3,5,784,"00:50:42,345","00:50:45,981","I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
"
3,5,785,"00:50:46,015","00:50:47,482","It should grow quickly.
"
3,5,786,"00:50:47,516","00:50:49,150","Joffrey won't let me leave.
"
3,5,787,"00:50:49,185","00:50:51,920","He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.
"
3,5,788,"00:50:51,954","00:50:55,290","And only one
to let you go.
"
3,5,789,"00:50:55,324","00:50:57,525","Because it will
please me.
"
3,5,790,"00:50:57,560","00:50:59,594","<i>Squire!</i>
"
3,5,791,"00:51:03,166","00:51:04,833","Well fought, ser.
"
3,5,792,"00:51:04,867","00:51:07,635","That was no fight.
I don't know you.
"
3,5,793,"00:51:07,670","00:51:10,004","Olyver,
if it please you.
"
3,5,794,"00:51:12,174","00:51:15,042","I should like to see you spar with
a proper partner, ser.

"
3,5,796,"00:51:24,653","00:51:26,554","Know what?
"
3,5,797,"00:51:27,889","00:51:29,724","That I wanted to.
"
3,5,798,"00:51:29,758","00:51:31,625","My lord...
"
3,5,799,"00:51:35,663","00:51:37,331","I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon
"
3,5,800,"00:51:37,365","00:51:40,434","and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.
"
3,5,801,"00:51:40,468","00:51:43,571","They rarely do,
in my experience.
"
3,5,802,"00:51:43,605","00:51:45,973","You have a good deal
of experience, do you?
"
3,5,803,"00:51:46,908","00:51:49,076","With the husbands.
"
3,5,804,"00:51:57,920","00:52:00,255","That didn't take long.
"
3,5,805,"00:52:00,290","00:52:02,492","Well, it took long enough.
"
3,5,806,"00:52:04,061","00:52:07,030","It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.
"
3,5,807,"00:52:07,064","00:52:08,865","Is he?
"
3,5,808,"00:52:08,899","00:52:11,200","And...
"
3,5,809,"00:52:11,235","00:52:13,036","who's the lucky girl?
"
3,5,810,"00:52:13,070","00:52:16,573","<i>She may not be the grandest</i>
<i>ship in the world</i>
"
3,5,811,"00:52:16,607","00:52:19,075","or the fastest,
"
3,5,812,"00:52:19,110","00:52:21,278","but she's mine.
"
3,5,813,"00:52:24,816","00:52:26,750","I've always wanted a ship.
"
3,5,814,"00:52:26,784","00:52:28,919","Now I want a dozen.
"
3,5,815,"00:52:28,954","00:52:31,589","- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?
"
3,5,816,"00:52:31,623","00:52:33,792","It doesn't matter
what we want,
"
3,5,817,"00:52:33,826","00:52:35,627","once we get it,
"
3,5,818,"00:52:35,661","00:52:37,396","then we want
something else.
"
3,5,819,"00:52:40,166","00:52:42,868","Your hair is different.
"
3,5,820,"00:52:42,902","00:52:44,536","Is it?
"
3,5,821,"00:52:44,570","00:52:46,171","Lady Margaery
wears it that way.
"
3,5,822,"00:52:46,205","00:52:48,607","Many ladies
wear it this way.
"
3,5,823,"00:52:48,641","00:52:50,376","I have good news.
"
3,5,824,"00:52:50,410","00:52:52,511","I'll be leaving
the city soon.
"
3,5,825,"00:52:52,545","00:52:54,012","You still want me
to come with you?
"
3,5,826,"00:52:54,047","00:52:56,248","It's not a question
of what I want.
"
3,5,827,"00:52:56,282","00:52:58,484","It's what you want.
"
3,5,828,"00:52:58,518","00:52:59,718","You want to go home,
don't you?
"
3,5,829,"00:52:59,752","00:53:02,187","Of course.
More than anything.
"
3,5,830,"00:53:04,357","00:53:07,759","But maybe it would
be better to wait.
"
3,5,831,"00:53:07,794","00:53:10,596","I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.
"
3,5,832,"00:53:10,630","00:53:13,498","Not just for me,
but for you.
"
3,5,833,"00:53:13,533","00:53:14,799","You've been so kind.
"
3,5,834,"00:53:14,834","00:53:18,002","I'd feel terrible if anything
happened to you.
"
3,5,835,"00:53:19,138","00:53:21,372","I can't tell you
how touched I am
"
3,5,836,"00:53:21,407","00:53:24,642","by your concern
for my welfare.
"
3,5,837,"00:53:24,677","00:53:27,479","I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.
"
3,5,838,"00:53:27,546","00:53:29,547","Your true friend.
"
3,5,839,"00:53:29,582","00:53:31,282","I do, Lord Baelish.
"
3,5,840,"00:53:31,317","00:53:33,986","- Petyr.
- Petyr.
"
3,5,841,"00:53:34,020","00:53:36,121","If you wish to stay,
"
3,5,842,"00:53:36,155","00:53:39,157","then of course
you will stay.
"
3,5,843,"00:53:44,063","00:53:46,431","We'll speak again
when I return.
"
3,5,844,"00:53:59,444","00:54:01,578","<i>You're late.</i>
"
3,5,845,"00:54:01,612","00:54:04,414","What's she doing here?

3,5,849,"00:54:11,990","00:54:15,058","that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

3,5,851,"00:54:17,161","00:54:19,963","hundreds of thousands

important to discuss.

3,5,856,"00:54:27,405","00:54:29,339","You're making me
uncomfortable.

3,5,857,"00:54:29,374","00:54:32,343","Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

- It wasn't my best, but--

and this is how they repay me,
"
3,5,865,"00:54:48,862","00:54:52,331","by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.
"
3,5,866,"00:54:52,365","00:54:54,033","Sansa is the key
to the North?

"
3,5,877,"00:55:21,663","00:55:23,397","And the Tyrells

Joffrey's wedding.

3,5,884,"00:55:44,952","00:55:46,419","I can and I do.
"
3,5,885,"00:55:46,454","00:55:49,556","Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

her father's head.
"

him and you give her to me?
"
3,5,888,"00:55:54,728","00:55:56,429","That's cruel even for you.
"
3,5,889,"00:55:56,464","00:55:58,331","Do you intend
on mistreating her?
"
3,5,890,"00:55:58,366","00:56:00,300","The girl's happiness
is not my concern,
"
3,5,891,"00:56:00,335","00:56:02,569","- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!
"
3,5,892,"00:56:02,604","00:56:05,473","She's flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed it at length.
"
3,5,893,"00:56:05,507","00:56:09,010","There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.
"
3,5,894,"00:56:09,044","00:56:12,080","- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>
- And if I refuse?
"
3,5,895,"00:56:12,115","00:56:14,784","You wanted to be rewarded

"
3,5,896,"00:56:14,818","00:56:18,821","Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

3,5,906,"00:56:43,614","00:56:45,481","You'll marry Ser Loras.
"
3,5,907,"00:56:47,651","00:56:50,086","- I will not.

"
3,6,163,"00:14:38,799","00:14:40,600","Keep your elbow high.
"
3,6,164,"00:14:40,634","00:14:43,603","You want your back
doing the hard labor.
"
3,6,165,"00:14:45,572","00:14:47,539","You're holding.
"
3,6,166,"00:14:47,574","00:14:49,308","Never hold.
"
3,6,167,"00:14:49,342","00:14:52,277","- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.
"
3,6,168,"00:14:52,311","00:14:54,579","Pull the string back
to the center of your chin
"
3,6,169,"00:14:54,613","00:14:56,080","and release.
"
3,6,170,"00:14:56,114","00:14:58,015","Never hold.
"
3,6,171,"00:14:58,050","00:15:00,084","But I have to aim.
"
3,6,172,"00:15:00,118","00:15:01,786","Never aim.
"
3,6,173,"00:15:01,820","00:15:03,387","Never aim?
"
3,6,174,"00:15:03,422","00:15:07,158","Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.
"
3,6,175,"00:15:07,192","00:15:09,393","Trust your eye.
"
3,6,176,"00:15:13,465","00:15:15,599","There's someone out there.
"
3,6,177,"00:15:33,584","00:15:36,653","That's about far enough.
"
3,6,178,"00:15:41,425","00:15:42,792","We come as friends.
"
3,6,179,"00:15:42,826","00:15:44,627","<i>Begging
your pardon, m'lady,</i>
"
3,6,180,"00:15:44,661","00:15:46,762","but we'll be
the judge of that.

don't speak High Valyrian.

3,6,184,"00:16:33,243","00:16:35,377","<i>Why are you here,
my lady?</i>
"
3,6,185,"00:16:47,991","00:16:50,092","Forgive my manners.
"
3,6,186,"00:16:51,194","00:16:53,128","I don't see many ladies
these days.
"
3,6,187,"00:16:53,163","00:16:55,030","Lucky for the ladies.
"
3,6,188,"00:17:24,493","00:17:26,594","How many times has
the Lord brought him back?
"
3,6,189,"00:17:26,629","00:17:28,463","Six.
"
3,6,190,"00:17:53,957","00:17:56,359","I've always been
a terrible priest.
"
3,6,191,"00:17:57,661","00:18:00,263","Drank too much rum.
"
3,6,192,"00:18:00,297","00:18:02,398","Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.
"
3,6,193,"00:18:02,432","00:18:05,134","It's a terrible
thing to say,
"
3,6,194,"00:18:05,168","00:18:09,070","but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.
"
3,6,195,"00:18:11,807","00:18:14,575","I decided that He,
that all the gods,
"
3,6,196,"00:18:14,610","00:18:18,146","<i>were stories we told
the children to make them behave.</i>
"
3,6,197,"00:18:19,948","00:18:22,918","So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,
"
3,6,198,"00:18:22,952","00:18:26,021","but it was just for show.
"
3,6,199,"00:18:27,791","00:18:30,760","A spectacle
for the locals.
"
3,6,200,"00:18:30,794","00:18:34,230","Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.
"
3,6,201,"00:18:38,469","00:18:41,772","I knelt beside
his cold body
"
3,6,202,"00:18:41,806","00:18:43,607","and said the old words.
"
3,6,203,"00:18:43,641","00:18:46,343","Not because I believed
in them, but...
"
3,6,204,"00:18:48,713","00:18:51,616","he was my friend
"
3,6,205,"00:18:51,650","00:18:53,952","and he was dead.
"
3,6,206,"00:18:55,154","00:18:57,089","And they were
the only words I knew.
"
3,6,207,"00:18:58,624","00:19:01,626","And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.
"
3,6,208,"00:19:03,862","00:19:05,963","Beric's eyes opened
"
3,6,209,"00:19:05,998","00:19:08,732","<i>and I knew the truth.</i>
"
3,6,210,"00:19:08,767","00:19:11,769","Our god
is the one true god.
"
3,6,211,"00:19:14,105","00:19:16,506","And all men
must serve Him.
"
3,6,212,"00:19:23,581","00:19:26,584","You've been
to the other side.
"
3,6,213,"00:19:27,452","00:19:29,587","The other side?
"
3,6,214,"00:19:30,689","00:19:33,491","There is no other side.
"
3,6,215,"00:19:34,593","00:19:37,194","I have been
to the darkness, my lady.
"
3,6,216,"00:19:41,166","00:19:44,002","He sent you to us
for a reason.
"
3,6,217,"00:19:45,471","00:19:47,806","You have someone
He needs.

3,6,220,"00:19:58,452","00:20:00,487","Can you make 'em?
"
3,6,221,"00:20:00,521","00:20:02,889","Yeah, nothing tricky
about it.
"
3,6,222,"00:20:02,924","00:20:05,225","Just need decent steel.
"
3,6,223,"00:20:05,259","00:20:06,559","I'll get you the steel.
"
3,6,224,"00:20:06,594","00:20:08,829","<i>Come on.</i>
"
3,6,225,"00:20:10,365","00:20:12,099","<i>I don't like that woman.</i>
"
3,6,226,"00:20:14,403","00:20:16,971","That's 'cause
you're a girl.
"
3,6,227,"00:20:17,005","00:20:18,739","What does that have
to do with anything?
"
3,6,228,"00:20:25,013","00:20:26,613","Forgive me, lad.
"
3,6,229,"00:20:30,718","00:20:33,486","What are you doing?
Let go of him.
"
3,6,230,"00:20:33,521","00:20:35,155","- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.
"
3,6,231,"00:20:35,189","00:20:36,989","He wants to be one of you.
"
3,6,232,"00:20:37,024","00:20:39,291","He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!
"
3,6,233,"00:20:39,326","00:20:41,493","We serve
the Lord of Light
"
3,6,234,"00:20:41,528","00:20:43,729","and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.
"
3,6,235,"00:20:43,763","00:20:46,365","Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?
"
3,6,236,"00:20:52,372","00:20:55,474","You're not doing this
for your god.
"
3,6,237,"00:20:55,508","00:20:57,176","You're doing it for gold.
"
3,6,238,"00:20:57,210","00:20:59,378","We're doing it
for both, girl.
"
3,6,239,"00:21:00,747","00:21:02,582","We can't defend the people
without weapons
"
3,6,240,"00:21:02,616","00:21:04,884","and horses and food.
"
3,6,241,"00:21:04,919","00:21:08,589","And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.
"
3,6,242,"00:21:08,623","00:21:11,558","You told me
this was a Brotherhood.
"
3,6,243,"00:21:11,592","00:21:14,061","You told me
I could be one of you.
"
3,6,244,"00:21:20,536","00:21:22,704","You are more
than they can ever be.
"
3,6,245,"00:21:22,738","00:21:25,606","They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.
"
3,6,246,"00:21:25,641","00:21:28,276","You will make kings
rise and fall.
"
3,6,247,"00:21:40,055","00:21:43,224","You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.
"
3,6,248,"00:21:48,297","00:21:50,498","I see a darkness in you.
"
3,6,249,"00:21:52,134","00:21:54,969","And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--
"
3,6,250,"00:21:55,004","00:21:57,005","brown eyes,
"
3,6,251,"00:21:57,039","00:22:00,309","blue eyes,
green eyes.
"
3,6,252,"00:22:00,343","00:22:03,512","Eyes you'll shut forever.
"
3,6,253,"00:22:06,951","00:22:09,052","We will meet again.
"
3,6,254,"00:23:24,331","00:23:26,999","You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?
"
3,6,255,"00:23:37,110","00:23:38,777","You all right?
"
3,6,256,"00:23:42,248","00:23:44,749","Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.
"
3,6,257,"00:23:58,364","00:24:01,466","Sorry.
Were you sleeping?
"
3,6,258,"00:24:01,500","00:24:03,568","Wa--
"
3,6,259,"00:24:05,204","00:24:08,640","Wa--? Wa--?
"
3,6,260,"00:24:09,776","00:24:11,577","Water?
"
3,6,261,"00:24:11,611","00:24:13,646","You want some water.
"
3,6,262,"00:24:16,183","00:24:18,718","I wish I had
some for you.
"
3,6,263,"00:24:32,701","00:24:35,102","So let's play a game.
"
3,6,264,"00:24:36,271","00:24:39,507","Which body part
do you need the least?
"
3,6,265,"00:24:41,110","00:24:44,579","- Please.
- Please is not a body part.
"
3,6,266,"00:24:44,614","00:24:46,915","I'll tell you everything,
please.
"
3,6,267,"00:24:46,949","00:24:51,486","But you've already
told me everything.
"
3,6,268,"00:24:51,521","00:24:54,022","<i>Remember?</i>
"
3,6,269,"00:24:54,056","00:24:56,492","Your daddy
was mean to you.
"
3,6,270,"00:24:56,526","00:24:59,862","The Starks didn't
appreciate you.
"
3,6,271,"00:25:00,930","00:25:03,499","One good bit, though.
"
3,6,272,"00:25:03,533","00:25:05,734","The Stark boys,
"
3,6,273,"00:25:05,768","00:25:08,470","they're still alive.
"
3,6,274,"00:25:09,605","00:25:13,607","Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?
"
3,6,275,"00:25:13,641","00:25:17,578","You failed, but I'm a better
hunter than you.
"
3,6,276,"00:25:19,314","00:25:21,315","<i>Now...</i>
"
3,6,277,"00:25:21,349","00:25:23,317","how about
your little finger?
"
3,6,278,"00:25:23,352","00:25:25,186","You don't use that
for much, do you?
"
3,6,279,"00:25:25,220","00:25:28,389","No? Good.
Let's start with that.
"
3,6,280,"00:25:38,434","00:25:41,102","You've been wondering
why you're here.
"
3,6,281,"00:25:41,136","00:25:43,638","<i>Haven't you?</i>
"
3,6,282,"00:25:43,672","00:25:45,506","<i>Where you are.</i>
"
3,6,283,"00:25:45,541","00:25:47,308","Who I am.
"
3,6,284,"00:25:47,343","00:25:50,144","Why I'm doing
this to you.
"
3,6,285,"00:25:51,747","00:25:53,982","So guess.
"
3,6,286,"00:25:54,016","00:25:56,251","<i>If you guess right,</i>
"
3,6,287,"00:25:56,285","00:25:57,852","I'll tell you.
"
3,6,288,"00:25:57,887","00:26:00,855","By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.
"
3,6,289,"00:26:02,791","00:26:04,292","You win the game
"
3,6,290,"00:26:04,326","00:26:06,394","if you can
figure out who I am
"
3,6,291,"00:26:06,428","00:26:07,962","and why
I'm torturing you
"
3,6,292,"00:26:07,997","00:26:11,332","and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.
"
3,6,293,"00:26:13,235","00:26:17,005","If I win,
you'll let me go?
"
3,6,294,"00:26:19,041","00:26:21,809","If you think this has
a happy ending,
"
3,6,295,"00:26:21,843","00:26:24,845","you haven't been
paying attention.
"
3,6,296,"00:26:24,879","00:26:26,513","Please.
"
3,6,297,"00:26:26,548","00:26:30,484","You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.
"
3,6,298,"00:26:33,921","00:26:36,089","You first.
"
3,6,299,"00:26:36,123","00:26:38,224","Where are we?
"
3,6,300,"00:26:39,226","00:26:41,828","- The North.
- Too vague.

3,6,302,"00:26:45,733","00:26:47,967","Terrible guess.
"
3,6,303,"00:26:55,643","00:26:58,178","Now, where?

"
3,6,305,"00:27:01,216","00:27:04,285","Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

3,6,306,"00:27:07,389","00:27:09,490","Karhold!
"
3,6,307,"00:27:16,297","00:27:18,031","Karhold?
"
3,6,308,"00:27:20,835","00:27:22,769","How did you know that?
"
3,6,309,"00:27:24,172","00:27:27,208","Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

3,6,310,"00:27:27,242","00:27:28,842","No.
"
3,6,311,"00:27:28,877","00:27:31,445","It was just a guess.

3,6,313,"00:27:37,520","00:27:38,920","And who am I?

to ask one question.

"
3,6,328,"00:28:59,966","00:29:03,202","Everything I told you
is a lie.
"
3,6,329,"00:29:05,906","00:29:08,709","This isn't happening
to you for a reason.
"
3,6,330,"00:29:08,743","00:29:12,479","Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.
"
3,6,331,"00:29:12,514","00:29:15,750","Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!
"
3,6,332,"00:29:21,890","00:29:23,491","I win.
"
3,6,333,"00:29:23,525","00:29:26,194","Thank you for riding
here so quickly.
"
3,6,334,"00:29:26,228","00:29:28,729","I know travel
isn't easy in these times.
"
3,6,335,"00:29:28,764","00:29:31,499","The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.
"
3,6,336,"00:29:31,533","00:29:35,003","But when the King
of the North summons us, we come.

3,6,337,"00:29:35,037","00:29:37,438","<i>Our father has
instructed us to tell you</i>

3,6,338,"00:29:37,473","00:29:40,208","that his alliance
with the North can continue
"
3,6,339,"00:29:40,242","00:29:42,911","if his terms are met.
"
3,6,340,"00:29:42,945","00:29:45,880","Lord Frey requires
a formal apology
"
3,6,341,"00:29:45,915","00:29:47,916","for your violation
of your sacred oath

3,6,342,"00:29:47,950","00:29:49,284","to marry one
of his daughters.
"
3,6,343,"00:29:49,318","00:29:52,420","Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.
"
3,6,344,"00:29:52,455","00:29:54,889","As restitution
for this betrayal,
"
3,6,345,"00:29:54,924","00:29:58,026","<i>he demands Harrenhal

"
3,6,346,"00:29:58,060","00:30:01,395","- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.
"
3,6,347,"00:30:02,431","00:30:04,398","Harrenhal is not
in the North.
"
3,6,348,"00:30:04,432","00:30:08,102","It is his
once the war is over
"
3,6,349,"00:30:08,136","00:30:10,771","and we have no further
strategic need for it.
"
3,6,350,"00:30:11,706","00:30:14,607","And there's
something else.
"
3,6,351,"00:30:14,642","00:30:17,443","We will do whatever we can
to give Lord Frey what he needs.
"
3,6,352,"00:30:17,478","00:30:21,047","Not what, whom.
"
3,6,353,"00:30:22,617","00:30:24,451","What?
"
3,6,354,"00:30:28,356","00:30:31,425","No.
"
3,6,355,"00:30:31,459","00:30:33,694","Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

3,6,356,"00:30:33,728","00:30:35,663","one of his daughters--
Roslin.
"
3,6,357,"00:30:35,697","00:30:37,532","How old is she?

3,6,358,"00:30:37,566","00:30:38,800","19.
"
3,6,359,"00:30:38,834","00:30:40,401","Could I see her first?
"
3,6,360,"00:30:40,435","00:30:41,569","You want to count
her teeth?

3,6,361,"00:30:41,603","00:30:44,338","<i>We depart for the Twins

3,6,363,"00:30:46,441","00:30:48,141","and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

3,6,364,"00:30:48,176","00:30:50,210","or this alliance
is at an end.
"
3,6,365,"00:30:50,244","00:30:52,813","Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

3,6,366,"00:30:52,847","00:30:55,515","Father is old.
"
3,6,367,"00:30:55,549","00:30:57,550","It will put
his heart at peace
"
3,6,368,"00:30:57,584","00:31:00,452","if he could see her wed
to a good husband.
"
3,6,369,"00:31:00,487","00:31:03,322","And his recent experience
has made him wary

3,6,371,"00:31:05,292","00:31:07,093","He has every right to be.

while we discuss it.
"
3,6,373,"00:31:26,981","00:31:30,550","Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?
"
3,6,374,"00:31:30,585","00:31:33,654","At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.
"
3,6,375,"00:31:33,688","00:31:35,122","I'm his liege lord.
"
3,6,376,"00:31:35,156","00:31:37,357","He's a proud man

"
3,6,377,"00:31:37,392","00:31:39,359","I didn't wound him.
"
3,6,378,"00:31:39,394","00:31:41,028","My answer is no.
"
3,6,379,"00:31:45,300","00:31:47,000","Listen to me
"
3,6,380,"00:31:47,035","00:31:50,004","and listen very carefully.
You--
"
3,6,381,"00:31:50,038","00:31:52,740","The laws of gods and men
are very clear.
"
3,6,382,"00:31:52,774","00:31:55,242","No man can compel
another man to marry.
"
3,6,383,"00:31:55,277","00:31:57,845","The laws of my fist

3,6,384,"00:31:57,879","00:32:01,081","It's all right.
You heard him.
"
3,6,385,"00:32:01,149","00:32:04,318","If you refuse, our alliance with
the Freys is dead.
"
3,6,386,"00:32:04,352","00:32:07,754","He's wanted me for one
of his daughters since I was 12.
"
3,6,387,"00:32:07,789","00:32:10,557","He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.
"
3,6,388,"00:32:10,592","00:32:12,960","When I say no,
he will come back
"

"
3,6,390,"00:32:15,030","00:32:16,864","You're willing to risk
our freedom

3,6,391,"00:32:16,898","00:32:19,333","and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?
"
3,6,392,"00:32:19,367","00:32:21,702","I have a war to fight.
"
3,6,393,"00:32:21,736","00:32:23,737","We can't win it
without them.
"
3,6,394,"00:32:23,772","00:32:25,606","I have no time to haggle.
"
3,6,395,"00:32:25,640","00:32:27,775","You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

3,6,396,"00:32:27,809","00:32:31,713","You recall that
heroic engagement?
"
3,6,397,"00:32:35,118","00:32:38,654","I had something
less permanent in mind.
"
3,6,398,"00:32:38,688","00:32:41,123","I've won every battle,
"
3,6,399,"00:32:41,157","00:32:42,992","but I'm losing this war.
"
3,6,400,"00:32:44,795","00:32:47,997","If we don't do this
and do it now,
"
3,6,401,"00:32:48,031","00:32:50,099","we're lost.
"
3,6,402,"00:32:55,505","00:32:57,373","I'll marry her.

3,6,403,"00:32:57,407","00:33:00,309","You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.
"
3,6,404,"00:33:00,343","00:33:03,179","It's not fair or right.
"
3,6,405,"00:33:03,213","00:33:05,014","I'll remember it.

"
3,6,408,"00:33:14,791","00:33:18,694","Yes. Most kind of them.

3,6,409,"00:33:18,728","00:33:20,795","You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.
"
3,6,410,"00:33:20,830","00:33:23,465","I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

3,6,411,"00:33:23,499","00:33:25,500","<i>to return Jaime Lannister
to King's Landing.</i>
"
3,6,412,"00:33:25,534","00:33:29,136","When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

"
3,6,414,"00:33:30,805","00:33:32,906","<i>he'd have hanged her

"
3,6,415,"00:33:40,114","00:33:42,381","I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

3,6,416,"00:33:42,415","00:33:44,650","You should.
"
3,6,417,"00:33:44,685","00:33:47,119","But instead,
you're sitting here
"
3,6,418,"00:33:47,154","00:33:49,789","watching me fail at dinner.
"
3,6,419,"00:33:49,823","00:33:51,991","Why might that be?
"
3,6,420,"00:33:52,025","00:33:53,893","Wars cost money.
"
3,6,421,"00:33:53,927","00:33:55,895","Many people would pay
a great deal for you.
"
3,6,422,"00:33:55,929","00:33:58,598","We both know
who would pay the most.
"
3,6,423,"00:34:00,134","00:34:01,701","<i>Or make you pay the most</i>
"
3,6,424,"00:34:01,735","00:34:03,402","if he found out
you had captured me
"
3,6,425,"00:34:03,437","00:34:05,671","and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.
"
3,6,426,"00:34:05,706","00:34:08,074","You're right.
"
3,6,427,"00:34:08,108","00:34:11,911","Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.
"
3,6,428,"00:34:11,946","00:34:13,880","It would be,
"
3,6,429,"00:34:13,915","00:34:17,217","if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.
"
3,6,430,"00:34:17,251","00:34:19,919","King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.
"
3,6,431,"00:34:19,954","00:34:22,288","He doesn't have time
for anything else.
"
3,6,432,"00:34:22,323","00:34:24,491","He'll make time for you.
"
3,6,433,"00:34:27,829","00:34:29,329","As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

3,6,435,"00:34:32,200","00:34:35,703","as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.
"
3,6,436,"00:34:35,738","00:34:39,106","And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,
"
3,6,437,"00:34:39,141","00:34:41,676","that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.
"
3,6,438,"00:34:48,450","00:34:51,118","- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.
"
3,6,439,"00:34:52,955","00:34:56,658","You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?
"
3,6,440,"00:34:58,127","00:35:00,128","Very well.

3,6,488,"00:37:06,518","00:37:07,952","<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>
"
3,6,489,"00:37:07,987","00:37:10,255","True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots
"
3,6,490,"00:37:10,289","00:37:13,458","over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...
"
3,6,491,"00:37:15,127","00:37:17,229","brothers and sisters--
"
3,6,492,"00:37:18,598","00:37:20,799","where I come from,
that stain
"
3,6,493,"00:37:20,834","00:37:23,302","would be very difficult
to wash out.
"
3,6,494,"00:37:23,336","00:37:25,938","I will not breathe
further life
"
3,6,495,"00:37:25,973","00:37:28,374","into a malicious lie
by discussing it.
"
3,6,496,"00:37:30,244","00:37:32,011","Lie or not,
"
3,6,497,"00:37:32,045","00:37:35,181","you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.
"
3,6,498,"00:37:35,216","00:37:37,751","Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands
"
3,6,499,"00:37:37,785","00:37:39,819","and send them off
to kill Lannisters
"
3,6,500,"00:37:39,854","00:37:42,889","and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.
"
3,6,501,"00:37:42,923","00:37:44,991","I don't care
what people believe.
"
3,6,502,"00:37:45,025","00:37:47,860","And neither do you.
"
3,6,503,"00:37:47,895","00:37:51,464","As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.
"
3,6,504,"00:37:51,532","00:37:55,669","Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,
"
3,6,505,"00:37:55,703","00:37:58,605","then Joffrey
is no king at all
"
3,6,506,"00:37:58,639","00:38:02,809","and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.
"
3,6,507,"00:38:02,844","00:38:06,547","And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,
"
3,6,508,"00:38:06,581","00:38:10,751","we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.
"
3,6,509,"00:38:10,786","00:38:14,322","It is a chance
we simply cannot take.
"
3,6,510,"00:38:14,356","00:38:16,891","The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.
"
3,6,511,"00:38:18,294","00:38:20,128","All right.
"
3,6,512,"00:38:20,162","00:38:22,696","I'll remove it for you.
"
3,6,513,"00:38:22,731","00:38:25,532","If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,
"
3,6,514,"00:38:25,567","00:38:28,435","I will name him
to the Kingsguard.
"
3,6,515,"00:38:28,469","00:38:31,904","<i>I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.</i>
"
3,6,516,"00:38:31,939","00:38:33,939","He will never marry.
"
3,6,517,"00:38:33,974","00:38:35,774","- He will never have children.
- Oh...
"
3,6,518,"00:38:35,809","00:38:37,709","<i>The Tyrell name
will fade.</i>
"
3,6,519,"00:38:37,744","00:38:40,412","And Highgarden will go
to the children
"
3,6,520,"00:38:40,446","00:38:41,947","of Joffrey
and Margaery.
"
3,6,521,"00:38:41,981","00:38:44,450","You would have
your grandson protected
"
3,6,522,"00:38:44,484","00:38:46,319","by someone
who disgusts you?
"
3,6,523,"00:38:46,353","00:38:49,956","I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior
"
3,6,524,"00:38:49,990","00:38:53,327","who takes his vows
seriously.
"
3,6,525,"00:38:53,361","00:38:56,196","So, shall I draw up
the order?
"
3,6,526,"00:38:57,732","00:39:00,134","Or do you consent
to this marriage?
"
3,6,527,"00:39:04,805","00:39:06,839","It's a rare enough thing--
"
3,6,528,"00:39:06,907","00:39:10,777","a man who lives up
to his reputation.
"
3,6,529,"00:40:03,628","00:40:04,962","No!
"
3,6,530,"00:40:24,550","00:40:26,351","We've gotta cut them loose!
"
3,6,531,"00:40:26,385","00:40:28,653","No!
"
3,6,532,"00:41:14,134","00:41:15,901","Take my hand!
"
3,6,533,"00:41:51,773","00:41:53,841","<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>
"
3,6,534,"00:41:53,875","00:41:57,378","Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.
"
3,6,535,"00:42:00,649","00:42:04,085","Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...
"
3,6,536,"00:42:09,258","00:42:12,793","I'm very happy about...
"
3,6,537,"00:42:12,827","00:42:14,628","Uh, yes.
"
3,6,538,"00:42:14,663","00:42:16,830","I-I am as well.
"
3,6,539,"00:42:19,134","00:42:21,168","I feel like
I'm in a dream.
"
3,6,540,"00:42:21,203","00:42:24,973","Yes, me, too.
Definitely.
"
3,6,541,"00:42:25,007","00:42:27,542","I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.
"
3,6,542,"00:42:27,577","00:42:28,777","The guests,
"
3,6,543,"00:42:28,811","00:42:31,980","the food,
the tournaments.
"
3,6,544,"00:42:35,052","00:42:37,587","And the bride,
of course.
"
3,6,545,"00:42:41,392","00:42:44,027","The most beautiful bride
in the world
"
3,6,546,"00:42:44,061","00:42:45,661","in a beautiful
gown of gold
"
3,6,547,"00:42:45,696","00:42:48,264","and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.
"
3,6,548,"00:42:50,701","00:42:52,936","Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?
"
3,6,549,"00:42:54,071","00:42:55,705","No. I had never
left Winterfell
"
3,6,550,"00:42:55,739","00:42:58,742","before I came
to King's Landing.
"
3,6,551,"00:42:58,776","00:43:00,343","But it sounds wonderful.
"
3,6,552,"00:43:00,378","00:43:02,979","I can't wait to see it.
"
3,6,553,"00:43:03,014","00:43:05,115","And to leave this place.
"
3,6,554,"00:43:06,217","00:43:07,985","It's terrible,
isn't it?
"
3,6,555,"00:43:10,488","00:43:12,990","The most terrible
place there is.
"
3,6,556,"00:43:22,501","00:43:25,736","<i>I don't suppose
there's anything we can do about this.</i>
"
3,6,557,"00:43:25,770","00:43:28,038","We can have them
both killed.
"
3,6,558,"00:43:29,841","00:43:31,808","It's hard to say
which of the four of us
"
3,6,559,"00:43:31,843","00:43:34,845","is getting the worst
of this arrangement.
"
3,6,560,"00:43:34,879","00:43:36,813","Probably Sansa.
"
3,6,561,"00:43:36,848","00:43:38,682","Though Loras
will certainly come to know
"
3,6,562,"00:43:38,716","00:43:41,485","a deep and singular misery.
"
3,6,563,"00:43:41,519","00:43:44,255","Father doesn't
discriminate.
"
3,6,564,"00:43:44,289","00:43:47,125","We're all being shipped
off to hell together.
"
3,6,565,"00:43:47,159","00:43:49,260","On a boat you built.
"
3,6,566,"00:43:49,295","00:43:52,331","The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.
"
3,6,567,"00:43:52,365","00:43:54,901","I did what I did
to protect our family.
"
3,6,568,"00:43:54,935","00:43:57,036","I'm your family.
"
3,6,569,"00:43:57,971","00:44:00,006","A member of your family
"
3,6,570,"00:44:00,040","00:44:03,076","who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.
"
3,6,571,"00:44:04,144","00:44:05,911","Whether or not
you or Father
"
3,6,572,"00:44:05,946","00:44:07,947","or anyone else
wants to admit it.
"
3,6,573,"00:44:07,982","00:44:10,283","I do admit it.
"
3,6,574,"00:44:10,317","00:44:12,952","If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,
"
3,6,575,"00:44:12,987","00:44:16,289","Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.
"
3,6,576,"00:44:16,323","00:44:19,392","<i>Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.</i>
"
3,6,577,"00:44:19,427","00:44:23,763","Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.
"
3,6,578,"00:44:25,900","00:44:27,968","There are two people
in King's Landing
"
3,6,579,"00:44:28,002","00:44:30,169","who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.
"
3,6,580,"00:44:30,204","00:44:33,173","Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon
"
3,6,581,"00:44:33,207","00:44:36,109","<i>to kill me during the Battle
of the Blackwater?</i>
"
3,6,582,"00:44:45,685","00:44:48,120","The impulse I understand.
"
3,6,583,"00:44:49,323","00:44:52,258","He hates me
because I'm the only one
"
3,6,584,"00:44:52,292","00:44:55,161","who tells him
what he really is.
"
3,6,585,"00:44:58,031","00:45:02,468","So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.
"
3,6,586,"00:45:02,503","00:45:04,504","But his stupidity?
"
3,6,587,"00:45:04,538","00:45:08,541","He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.
"
3,6,588,"00:45:08,576","00:45:12,044","But the king
orders a Kingsguard
"
3,6,589,"00:45:12,079","00:45:14,247","to murder
the Hand of the King
"
3,6,590,"00:45:14,281","00:45:16,182","in full view
of his own army.
"
3,6,591,"00:45:16,216","00:45:17,750","The boy's an idiot.
"
3,6,592,"00:45:17,785","00:45:19,185","What do you
want me to say?
"
3,6,593,"00:45:19,219","00:45:22,221","I want you to tell me if my life
is still in danger.
"
3,6,594,"00:45:22,256","00:45:23,990","Probably.
"
3,6,595,"00:45:24,024","00:45:25,725","But not from Joffrey.
"
3,6,596,"00:45:25,760","00:45:27,927","He won't do anything
now Father's here.
"
3,6,597,"00:45:29,597","00:45:32,199","Seven kingdoms
united in fear
"
3,6,598,"00:45:32,233","00:45:34,367","of Tywin Lannister.
"
3,6,599,"00:45:34,402","00:45:36,770","Not the Tyrells.
"
3,6,600,"00:45:36,804","00:45:38,839","Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.
"
3,6,601,"00:45:38,873","00:45:40,307","Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,
"
3,6,602,"00:45:40,341","00:45:42,242","the little
doe-eyed whore.
"
3,6,603,"00:45:42,276","00:45:45,278","And so will his children
and their children.
"
3,6,604,"00:45:45,313","00:45:47,548","History will be taken
from our hands.
"
3,6,605,"00:45:49,551","00:45:52,119","You may escape,
at least.
"
3,6,606,"00:45:52,153","00:45:53,787","Once Jaime gets back,
"
3,6,607,"00:45:53,822","00:45:56,323","Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case
"
3,6,608,"00:45:56,358","00:45:59,560","of sword through bowels.
"
3,6,609,"00:45:59,594","00:46:01,562","When Jaime gets back, yes.
"
3,6,610,"00:46:01,596","00:46:03,264","But when do we think
that's going to be?
"
3,6,611,"00:46:03,298","00:46:05,132","He's out there somewhere.
"
3,6,612,"00:46:06,935","00:46:10,805","Jaime or not,
I'm truly fucked.
"
3,6,613,"00:46:13,876","00:46:16,011","Who's going to tell her?
"
3,6,614,"00:46:17,413","00:46:19,747","Do you think
people will like it?
"
3,6,615,"00:46:19,782","00:46:22,283","I don't think they
will even notice it.
"
3,6,616,"00:46:22,317","00:46:24,786","You're right.
It's not my wedding.
"
3,6,617,"00:46:26,288","00:46:27,756","Anyway, from what
I can tell,
"
3,6,618,"00:46:27,790","00:46:29,958","the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior
"
3,6,619,"00:46:29,992","00:46:31,559","to the ones
in King's Landing.
"
3,6,620,"00:46:31,594","00:46:34,929","They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.
"
3,6,621,"00:46:36,132","00:46:38,833","Loras likes green
and gold brocade.
"
3,6,622,"00:46:38,868","00:46:40,735","I'm sure he does.
"
3,6,623,"00:46:42,204","00:46:44,138","Will they let me
invite my family?
"
3,6,624,"00:46:44,173","00:46:46,574","They haven't asked
my opinion.
"
3,6,625,"00:46:46,608","00:46:48,977","But do you think
they will?
"
3,6,626,"00:46:49,011","00:46:50,612","No.
"
3,6,627,"00:46:57,553","00:46:59,253","Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.
"
3,6,628,"00:46:59,288","00:47:02,123","- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.
"
3,6,629,"00:47:02,158","00:47:04,526","Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.
"
3,6,630,"00:47:04,561","00:47:07,096","I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.
"
3,6,631,"00:47:08,565","00:47:13,035","Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.
"
3,6,632,"00:47:13,069","00:47:15,471","I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.
"
3,6,633,"00:47:15,506","00:47:17,006","Of course.
"
3,6,634,"00:47:17,040","00:47:19,709","Alone, if I may.
"
3,6,635,"00:47:19,744","00:47:21,444","Why do you need
to speak to her alone?
"
3,6,636,"00:47:21,479","00:47:23,280","Shae.
"
3,6,637,"00:47:23,314","00:47:25,081","Please excuse her,
Lord Tyrion.
"
3,6,638,"00:47:25,116","00:47:26,617","<i>She's not from here.</i>
"
3,6,639,"00:47:26,651","00:47:27,851","But I trust her,
"
3,6,640,"00:47:27,885","00:47:30,154","even though
she tells me not to.
"
3,6,641,"00:47:31,823","00:47:35,660","Sometimes we think
we want to hear something
"
3,6,642,"00:47:35,694","00:47:38,763","<i>and it's only afterwards
when it's too late</i>
"
3,6,643,"00:47:38,797","00:47:41,565","that we realize
we wished we'd heard it
"
3,6,644,"00:47:41,600","00:47:43,734","under entirely
different circumstances.
"
3,6,645,"00:47:43,769","00:47:45,603","It's all right, really.
"
3,6,646,"00:47:49,140","00:47:51,375","How to begin?
"
3,6,647,"00:47:53,945","00:47:56,513","It's-- this--
"

3,7,106,"00:08:56,771","00:08:59,606","Does she know
her daughter's a queen?
"
3,7,107,"00:08:59,640","00:09:01,742","Not yet.
"
3,7,108,"00:09:03,345","00:09:06,080","That will be
a surprise, I expect.
"
3,7,109,"00:09:08,684","00:09:10,718","Many surprises for her.
"
3,7,110,"00:09:14,791","00:09:17,392","How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war
"
3,7,111,"00:09:17,427","00:09:19,728","when you're over there
looking like that?
"
3,7,112,"00:09:23,666","00:09:26,935","Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?
"
3,7,113,"00:09:26,969","00:09:29,538","<i>When all this is over?</i>
"
3,7,114,"00:09:29,572","00:09:31,807","I will.
"
3,7,115,"00:09:31,841","00:09:34,210","I promise.
"
3,7,116,"00:09:38,415","00:09:41,918","<i>I know she'd love to meet you.</i>
"
3,7,117,"00:09:42,853","00:09:45,054","And her grandchild.
"
3,7,118,"00:09:48,359","00:09:50,860","What, now?
"
3,7,119,"00:09:55,666","00:09:57,934","Are you certain?
"
3,7,120,"00:09:59,603","00:10:02,105","Are you angry with me?
"
3,7,121,"00:10:02,139","00:10:03,907","Angry?
"
3,7,122,"00:10:07,078","00:10:09,312","You're my queen.
"
3,7,123,"00:10:11,983","00:10:15,852","And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.
"
3,7,124,"00:10:16,954","00:10:19,389","Maybe one of each.
"
3,7,125,"00:10:19,423","00:10:21,424","Don't get greedy.
"
3,7,126,"00:10:30,967","00:10:33,669","Can you leave the war
for one night?
"
3,7,127,"00:10:35,940","00:10:38,074","I love you.
"
3,7,128,"00:10:39,243","00:10:41,979","Do you hear me?
"
3,7,129,"00:10:42,013","00:10:44,515","I love you.
"
3,7,130,"00:10:58,597","00:11:01,599","Most men fuck like dogs.
"
3,7,131,"00:11:03,802","00:11:06,236","No grace, no skill.
"
3,7,132,"00:11:06,271","00:11:08,305","A few dozen thrusts and done.
"
3,7,133,"00:11:08,339","00:11:11,441","You need to be patient.
Give her time.
"
3,7,134,"00:11:11,475","00:11:13,743","Your cock shouldn't go near her
"
3,7,135,"00:11:13,777","00:11:17,079","till she's slick
as a baby seal.
"
3,7,136,"00:11:17,113","00:11:19,848","And then you go inside,
"
3,7,137,"00:11:19,883","00:11:21,517","<i>but slowly.</i>
"
3,7,138,"00:11:21,551","00:11:24,987","Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.
"
3,7,139,"00:11:25,021","00:11:26,589","Come on!
"
3,7,140,"00:11:26,623","00:11:30,059","Hey, come on.
"
3,7,141,"00:11:41,705","00:11:44,373","You think he
loves you, is that it?
"
3,7,142,"00:11:44,408","00:11:47,243","What did he tell you? He's
gonna make you his lady
"
3,7,143,"00:11:47,277","00:11:49,746","and live with you
in some castle?
"
3,7,144,"00:11:49,780","00:11:52,415","No, he didn't tell me anything.
"
3,7,145,"00:11:52,450","00:11:54,184","He barely talks.
"
3,7,146,"00:11:54,218","00:11:56,420","I've seen you two
whispering in the night,
"
3,7,147,"00:11:56,454","00:11:58,622","giggling like a pair of girls.
"
3,7,148,"00:11:58,656","00:12:00,523","What, you're jealous?
"
3,7,149,"00:12:00,558","00:12:02,459","Of course I'm jealous.
"
3,7,150,"00:12:02,493","00:12:04,327","You should be
with one of your own.
"
3,7,151,"00:12:04,361","00:12:06,162","And you're one of my own?
"
3,7,152,"00:12:06,196","00:12:07,956","I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.
"
3,7,153,"00:12:07,965","00:12:11,166","You would if you were mine.
"
3,7,154,"00:12:13,135","00:12:15,870","I'd tell you
that you're beautiful
"
3,7,155,"00:12:15,905","00:12:19,241","and fierce and wild.
"
3,7,156,"00:12:19,275","00:12:21,409","I'd be good to you.
"
3,7,157,"00:12:24,213","00:12:26,347","You love him?
"
3,7,158,"00:12:32,854","00:12:35,522","'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?
"
3,7,159,"00:12:35,557","00:12:38,659","You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?
"
3,7,160,"00:12:40,495","00:12:43,297","- You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
- Don't touch me.
"
3,7,161,"00:12:43,331","00:12:46,534","You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.
"
3,7,162,"00:12:49,871","00:12:53,674","Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,
"
3,7,163,"00:12:53,708","00:12:57,845","to come here to the capital.
"
3,7,164,"00:12:57,880","00:13:00,514","See the southern knights
and their painted armor
"
3,7,165,"00:13:00,549","00:13:04,018","and King's Landing
after dark--
"
3,7,166,"00:13:05,320","00:13:08,556","all the candles burning
in all those windows.
"
3,7,167,"00:13:10,726","00:13:12,726","I'm stupid.
"
3,7,168,"00:13:13,595","00:13:15,229","A stupid little girl
"
3,7,169,"00:13:15,263","00:13:18,232","with stupid dreams
who never learns.
"
3,7,170,"00:13:18,266","00:13:20,200","Come on.
"
3,7,171,"00:13:21,969","00:13:24,104","Come walk with me.
"
3,7,172,"00:13:25,840","00:13:28,808","I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.
"
3,7,173,"00:13:28,843","00:13:32,111","I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.
"
3,7,174,"00:13:32,146","00:13:34,580","I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,
"
3,7,175,"00:13:34,614","00:13:36,749","and so does my grandmother.
"
3,7,176,"00:13:39,285","00:13:41,787","You would have been
happy at Highgarden.
"
3,7,177,"00:13:41,821","00:13:43,355","But women in our position
"
3,7,178,"00:13:43,390","00:13:46,392","must make the best
of our circumstances.
"
3,7,179,"00:13:46,426","00:13:49,429","How do I make the best
of my circumstances?
"
3,7,180,"00:13:49,463","00:13:51,731","I have to marry him.
"
3,7,181,"00:13:53,033","00:13:56,770","- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.
"
3,7,182,"00:13:56,804","00:13:59,306","Has he been kind to you?
"
3,7,183,"00:13:59,340","00:14:01,608","He's tried.
"
3,7,184,"00:14:01,642","00:14:03,109","You don't want him, though.
"
3,7,185,"00:14:03,144","00:14:04,444","He's a Lannister.
"
3,7,186,"00:14:04,478","00:14:07,080","Far from the worst
Lannister, wouldn't you say?
"
3,7,187,"00:14:09,083","00:14:10,317","I'm sorry.
"
3,7,188,"00:14:10,351","00:14:13,186","Here I am complaining to you...
"
3,7,189,"00:14:13,220","00:14:15,789","My son will be king.
"
3,7,190,"00:14:15,823","00:14:17,291","Sons learn from their mothers.
"
3,7,191,"00:14:17,325","00:14:20,226","I plan to teach mine
a great deal.
"
3,7,192,"00:14:20,261","00:14:23,063","And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,
"
3,7,193,"00:14:23,097","00:14:27,034","your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock
"
3,7,194,"00:14:27,068","00:14:28,936","and the North someday.
"
3,7,195,"00:14:31,139","00:14:33,240","What?
"
3,7,196,"00:14:34,208","00:14:35,742","My son...
"
3,7,197,"00:14:35,776","00:14:37,877","with him.
"
3,7,198,"00:14:39,980","00:14:42,649","I'll have to--
"
3,7,199,"00:14:42,683","00:14:44,618","we'll have to--
"
3,7,200,"00:14:44,652","00:14:46,587","If it's the pain
you're worried about--
"
3,7,201,"00:14:46,621","00:14:48,822","I'm not afraid of the pain.
"
3,7,202,"00:14:48,856","00:14:50,958","Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.
"
3,7,203,"00:14:50,992","00:14:52,593","What is it, then?
"
3,7,204,"00:14:54,662","00:14:57,131","He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.
"
3,7,205,"00:14:57,165","00:14:59,367","Especially with the scar.
"
3,7,206,"00:14:59,401","00:15:01,802","He's a dwarf.
"
3,7,207,"00:15:01,837","00:15:04,038","And Loras--
"
3,7,208,"00:15:04,073","00:15:05,840","Loras.
"
3,7,209,"00:15:08,778","00:15:11,079","Some women like tall men.
"
3,7,210,"00:15:11,113","00:15:12,748","Some like short men.
"
3,7,211,"00:15:12,782","00:15:15,551","Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.
"
3,7,212,"00:15:15,585","00:15:18,787","Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,
"
3,7,213,"00:15:18,822","00:15:21,190","pretty girls.
"
3,7,214,"00:15:21,224","00:15:24,293","Most women don't know what they
like until they've tried it.
"
3,7,215,"00:15:24,327","00:15:27,963","And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little
"
3,7,216,"00:15:27,997","00:15:30,265","before we're old and gray.
"
3,7,217,"00:15:31,734","00:15:33,335","Tyrion may surprise you.
"
3,7,218,"00:15:33,370","00:15:37,072","From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.
"
3,7,219,"00:15:37,106","00:15:40,342","And that's a good thing?
"
3,7,220,"00:15:40,377","00:15:41,777","<i>It can be.</i>
"
3,7,221,"00:15:41,812","00:15:43,579","We're very complicated,
you know.
"
3,7,222,"00:15:43,614","00:15:45,948","Pleasing us takes practice.
"
3,7,223,"00:15:45,983","00:15:48,384","How do you know all this?
"
3,7,224,"00:15:48,418","00:15:50,819","Did your mother teach you?
"
3,7,225,"00:15:54,057","00:15:56,858","Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.
"
3,7,226,"00:16:00,263","00:16:02,365","<i>She's a child.</i>
"
3,7,227,"00:16:02,399","00:16:03,933","<i>She's a foot
taller than you.</i>
"
3,7,228,"00:16:03,967","00:16:05,768","A tall child.
"
3,7,229,"00:16:05,802","00:16:07,837","What's the youngest
you've ever had?
"
3,7,230,"00:16:07,871","00:16:09,372","Not that young.
"
3,7,231,"00:16:09,407","00:16:11,641","How much older?
"
3,7,232,"00:16:11,676","00:16:13,410","Older.
"
3,7,233,"00:16:13,444","00:16:16,547","You're a lord, she's a lady.
"
3,7,234,"00:16:16,581","00:16:18,415","And a beauty at that.
"
3,7,235,"00:16:18,449","00:16:19,983","I don't see the problem.
"
3,7,236,"00:16:20,018","00:16:22,286","Shae isn't going to like it.
"
3,7,237,"00:16:22,320","00:16:24,054","Shae is a whore.
"
3,7,238,"00:16:24,089","00:16:26,691","Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?
"
3,7,239,"00:16:26,725","00:16:29,794","How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?
"
3,7,240,"00:16:29,829","00:16:32,764","I should never have
told you about that.
"
3,7,241,"00:16:32,798","00:16:36,167","You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.
"
3,7,242,"00:16:36,202","00:16:39,371","All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.
"
3,7,243,"00:16:39,405","00:16:41,273","He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.
"
3,7,244,"00:16:41,307","00:16:43,508","You can rule the North
in his name.
"
3,7,245,"00:16:43,542","00:16:46,311","You'll have two women and a
whole kingdom of your own.
"
3,7,246,"00:16:46,345","00:16:48,180","Two women to despise me
"
3,7,247,"00:16:48,214","00:16:50,515","and a whole kingdom
to join them.
"
3,7,248,"00:16:52,018","00:16:55,353","You waste time trying
to get people to love you,
"
3,7,249,"00:16:55,388","00:16:58,156","you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.
"
3,7,250,"00:17:02,261","00:17:04,263","You want to fuck
that Stark girl.
"
3,7,251,"00:17:04,297","00:17:06,898","<i>You just don't want</i>

"
3,7,252,"00:17:06,933","00:17:10,836","I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.
"
3,7,253,"00:17:10,870","00:17:13,706","The ones already there
don't need company.
"
3,7,254,"00:17:13,740","00:17:16,308","You pay me to kill people

3,7,255,"00:17:18,678","00:17:21,213","Evil notions come free.
"
3,7,256,"00:17:53,344","00:17:55,279","Your Grace.

3,7,257,"00:17:55,313","00:17:57,415","Grandfather.
"
3,7,258,"00:17:57,449","00:17:59,751","You wanted to speak to me?

3,7,259,"00:17:59,785","00:18:01,552","Yes.
"
3,7,260,"00:18:01,587","00:18:05,590","I'd like a report on the
meetings of my small council.

3,7,264,"00:18:11,465","00:18:13,300","I've been very busy.
"
3,7,265,"00:18:13,334","00:18:15,936","Many important matters
require a king's attention.
"
3,7,266,"00:18:15,970","00:18:18,138","Of course.
"
3,7,267,"00:18:19,273","00:18:21,708","You've been holding
the council meetings

3,7,268,"00:18:21,742","00:18:25,311","in the Tower of the Hand instead
of the small council chamber.
"
3,7,269,"00:18:25,346","00:18:27,013","I have, yes.

"
3,7,271,"00:18:30,084","00:18:33,086","The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.
"
3,7,272,"00:18:33,121","00:18:36,289","To walk from there
to here would take time,
"
3,7,273,"00:18:36,323","00:18:38,992","time I could otherwise
spend productively.
"
3,7,274,"00:18:39,026","00:18:41,394","So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,
"
3,7,275,"00:18:41,429","00:18:45,298","I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
"
3,7,276,"00:19:00,481","00:19:03,617","We could arrange
to have you carried.
"
3,7,277,"00:19:06,888","00:19:08,922","Tell me about
the Targaryen girl
"
3,7,278,"00:19:08,957","00:19:11,991","in the east and her dragons.
"
3,7,279,"00:19:12,026","00:19:13,660","Where did you hear about this?

3,7,280,"00:19:13,694","00:19:16,162","Is it true?
"
3,7,281,"00:19:16,196","00:19:18,264","Apparently so.
"
3,7,282,"00:19:20,267","00:19:24,536","Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?
"
3,7,283,"00:19:25,638","00:19:27,272","When I was Hand of the King
"
3,7,284,"00:19:27,307","00:19:29,541","under your father's
predecessor,
"
3,7,285,"00:19:29,575","00:19:32,177","the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

3,7,286,"00:19:32,211","00:19:34,645","were kept in this room.

"
3,7,288,"00:19:38,450","00:19:40,484","was right here.
"
3,7,289,"00:19:40,518","00:19:43,954","It was the size of an apple.
"
3,7,290,"00:19:45,156","00:19:47,958","And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.
"
3,7,291,"00:19:48,026","00:19:50,761","Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged
"
3,7,292,"00:19:50,795","00:19:53,964","died 300 years ago.

3,7,293,"00:19:53,999","00:19:56,600","Curiosities on the far
side of the world

3,7,295,"00:19:58,003","00:20:01,405","But how do we know these
dragons are just curiosities
"
3,7,296,"00:20:01,440","00:20:04,475","and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?
"
3,7,297,"00:20:04,509","00:20:07,478","Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

which he knows nothing.
"
3,7,300,"00:20:11,650","00:20:14,084","But I haven't been counseled.

3,7,302,"00:20:19,491","00:20:23,027","I should be consulted
about such things.

little lord.

None of you know.

"
3,7,694,"00:47:59,062","00:48:01,396","I had a man once.

"
3,7,698,"00:48:08,038","00:48:11,006","But one night Bruni disappears.
"
3,7,699,"00:48:11,041","00:48:13,642","People said he left me,
"
3,7,700,"00:48:13,676","00:48:15,010","but I knew him.
"
3,7,701,"00:48:15,044","00:48:18,980","<i>He'd never leave me.</i>

"
3,7,702,"00:48:19,014","00:48:21,383","I knew he'd come back.
"
3,7,703,"00:48:23,052","00:48:25,153","And he did.
"
3,7,704,"00:48:26,389","00:48:29,558","<i>He came in through</i>

"
3,7,705,"00:48:30,427","00:48:32,395","Only it wasn't Bruni.
"
3,7,706,"00:48:32,429","00:48:34,997","Not really.
"
3,7,707,"00:48:35,032","00:48:38,568","His skin was pale
"
3,7,708,"00:48:38,602","00:48:41,971","like a dead man's.
"
3,7,709,"00:48:42,006","00:48:44,841","His eyes bluer than clear sky.

3,7,710,"00:48:48,580","00:48:50,348","<i>He came at me,</i>
"
3,7,711,"00:48:50,382","00:48:52,350","grabbed me by the neck
"
3,7,712,"00:48:52,384","00:48:55,220","and squeezed so hard
"
3,7,713,"00:48:55,254","00:48:58,090","I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

3,7,714,"00:49:00,393","00:49:02,828","<i>I don't know</i>

"
3,7,719,"00:49:22,549","00:49:25,284","I didn't ask the gods

3,7,720,"00:49:25,318","00:49:29,054","I didn't need to.
I already knew.

3,7,723,"00:49:36,897","00:49:39,132","I promised your maester

pain, my lord?

3,7,726,"00:49:54,880","00:49:57,982","What's the purpose

3,7,738,"00:50:32,618","00:50:34,919","What is?

the perfect castle for us.

3,9,188,"00:13:26,580","00:13:30,049","It's got a secret sally port,

3,9,192,"00:13:39,192","00:13:41,092","right down into the Nightfort,

3,9,196,"00:13:53,338","00:13:57,241","I read about it

3,9,202,"00:14:30,376","00:14:34,747","that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.
"
3,9,203,"00:14:34,782","00:14:37,283","Here we are.

3,9,222,"00:15:44,685","00:15:47,420","You're wrong.
I know a killer.

3,9,223,"00:15:47,455","00:15:50,090","- A real killer.
- That so?
"
3,9,224,"00:15:50,124","00:15:51,725","You'd be like a kitten to him.
"
3,9,225,"00:15:51,759","00:15:54,094","He'd kill you
with his little finger.
"

"
3,9,227,"00:15:57,598","00:15:59,632","- No.

4,3,40,"00:06:27,686","00:06:30,371","Because he was
a drunk and a fool
"
4,3,41,"00:06:30,465","00:06:33,229","and I don't trust drunk fools.
"
4,3,42,"00:06:33,325","00:06:35,510","He saved me.
"
4,3,43,"00:06:35,587","00:06:38,480","Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.
"
4,3,44,"00:06:38,581","00:06:42,794","Every one of them.

because I saved his life.
"
4,3,48,"00:06:54,167","00:06:58,154","Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

to his grandmother.
"
4,3,50,"00:07:01,403","00:07:04,455","The last legacy

"
4,3,61,"00:07:46,396","00:07:48,131","More than you were with Renly.
"
4,3,62,"00:07:48,192","00:07:51,198","Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

"
4,3,67,"00:08:01,282","00:08:04,063","looking to his mother to make

4,3,69,"00:08:06,688","00:08:09,048","But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.
"
4,3,70,"00:08:10,597","00:08:13,619","They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?
"
4,3,71,"00:08:13,724","00:08:15,492","Made me look at it.
"
4,3,72,"00:08:15,554","00:08:17,033","What was it like?
"
4,3,73,"00:08:17,086","00:08:20,187","They took me to the Great

"
4,3,75,"00:08:22,157","00:08:25,292","and suffered to father
my children.
"
4,3,76,"00:08:25,401","00:08:27,618","A great doughy lump

"
4,3,80,"00:08:40,338","00:08:42,459","One of my husbands
preferred the company of men
"
4,3,81,"00:08:42,533","00:08:44,141","and was stabbed
through the heart.
"
4,3,82,"00:08:44,198","00:08:46,528","Another was happiest
torturing animals
"
4,3,83,"00:08:46,609","00:08:48,779","and was poisoned

I can promise you that.
"
4,3,89,"00:09:02,293","00:09:04,334","But I would have been the queen.

could work miracles.

himself into an early grave

4,3,116,"00:10:32,280","00:10:34,481","and this world was sinful.

something inappropriate.

4,4,167,"00:14:23,469","00:14:25,470","Which is why
we're having a trial.

4,4,169,"00:14:27,840","00:14:30,592","If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

"
4,4,176,"00:14:46,659","00:14:49,444","She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
"
4,4,177,"00:14:49,446","00:14:51,947","Do you think it's a coincidence she
disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

"
4,4,179,"00:14:55,284","00:14:57,502","Sansa's not a killer.

a crown on his head,
"
4,4,227,"00:17:41,867","00:17:44,119","is not a reliable ally.

4,4,228,"00:17:44,170","00:17:46,121","And who could trust

"
4,4,229,"00:17:46,172","00:17:48,423","Who could trust you?

4,4,230,"00:17:49,675","00:17:51,960","I don't want friends like me.
"
4,4,231,"00:17:52,011","00:17:54,462","My new friends are predictable.

4,4,232,"00:17:54,513","00:17:56,014","Very reasonable people.

"
4,4,247,"00:18:32,335","00:18:34,252","Have they even agreed
to the match?
"
4,4,248,"00:18:34,303","00:18:36,004","No one tells me anything.
"
4,4,249,"00:18:36,055","00:18:40,258","I wasn't originally meant to marry
your grandfather Luthor, you know.
"
4,4,250,"00:18:40,309","00:18:42,677","He was engaged to my sister,
"
4,4,251,"00:18:42,679","00:18:44,846","your great-aunt Viola.
"
4,4,252,"00:18:44,897","00:18:48,149","I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.
"
4,4,253,"00:18:48,184","00:18:51,903","Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.
"
4,4,254,"00:18:51,937","00:18:54,489","But the moment
I saw my intended,
"
4,4,255,"00:18:54,523","00:18:57,859","with his twitchy
little ferret's face
"
4,4,256,"00:18:57,910","00:18:59,861","and ludicrous silver hair,
"
4,4,257,"00:18:59,863","00:19:01,913","I knew he wouldn't do.
"
4,4,258,"00:19:01,947","00:19:04,499","So the evening
"
4,4,259,"00:19:04,533","00:19:07,585","before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,
"
4,4,260,"00:19:07,620","00:19:10,288","I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson
"
4,4,261,"00:19:10,339","00:19:12,624","and happened upon his chamber.
"
4,4,262,"00:19:12,675","00:19:13,875","(laughs)
"
4,4,263,"00:19:13,877","00:19:16,211","— How absent-minded of me.
— Mm-mmh.
"
4,4,264,"00:19:16,262","00:19:20,432","The following morning, Luthor
never made it down the stairs
"
4,4,265,"00:19:20,466","00:19:24,219","to propose to my sister 'cause
the boy couldn't bloody walk.
"
4,4,266,"00:19:24,221","00:19:26,554","And once he could,
the only thing he wanted
"
4,4,267,"00:19:26,556","00:19:28,973","was what I'd given him
the night before.
"
4,4,268,"00:19:29,025","00:19:31,192","I was good.
"
4,4,269,"00:19:31,227","00:19:33,895","I was very, very good.
"
4,4,270,"00:19:35,731","00:19:38,366","You are even better.
"
4,4,271,"00:19:38,401","00:19:39,984","But you need to act quickly.
"
4,4,272,"00:19:40,036","00:19:43,872","Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.
"
4,4,273,"00:19:43,906","00:19:46,791","She'll turn the boy against
you as soon as she can.
"
4,4,274,"00:19:46,826","00:19:50,128","And by the time you're
married, it'll be too late.
"
4,4,275,"00:19:50,162","00:19:52,130","Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent
"
4,4,276,"00:19:52,164","00:19:53,998","is rather distracted
at the moment,
"
4,4,277,"00:19:54,050","00:19:56,468","mourning her dear departed boy.
"
4,4,278,"00:19:56,502","00:19:58,887","Accusing her brother
of his murder,
"
4,4,279,"00:19:58,921","00:20:00,889","which he didn't commit.
"
4,4,280,"00:20:00,923","00:20:02,057","Well, he could have done.
"
4,4,281,"00:20:02,091","00:20:04,008","He could have done,
but he didn't.
"
4,4,282,"00:20:04,060","00:20:07,062","— You don't know, Grandmother.
— But I do know.
"
4,4,283,"00:20:07,096","00:20:11,683","You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?
"
4,4,284,"00:20:12,768","00:20:15,770","What?
I don't understand.
"
4,4,285,"00:20:15,821","00:20:19,441","Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.
"
4,4,286,"00:20:21,744","00:20:24,112","You just do
what needs to be done.

4,6,421,"00:29:04,259","00:29:06,544","You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

4,6,429,"00:29:28,151","00:29:30,985","But I was never interested

Spain thrown into it as well.
"
5,0,24,"00:01:54,013","00:01:56,147","So I'm line producing
both of them this year.
"
5,0,25,"00:01:56,182","00:01:59,266","And even though last year was
big, this one's even bigger.

5,0,49,"00:03:08,254","00:03:10,888","It is the rehearsal before the show.
"
5,0,50,"00:03:19,348","00:03:23,684","We're heading from our unit base
into Dubrovnik, into the old town.

from filming in Belfast</i>
"
5,0,52,"00:03:26,906","00:03:29,273","<i>'cause the logistics over here</i>
<i>are very different.</i>
"
5,0,53,"00:03:29,275","00:03:31,442","<i>One of the logistical</i>
<i>problems of Dubrovnik</i>
"
5,0,54,"00:03:31,444","00:03:33,861","<i>is it's such a tight,</i>
<i>small, old city</i>
"
5,0,55,"00:03:33,913","00:03:36,781","<i>that we can't get our big
vehicles actually into the town</i>
"
5,0,56,"00:03:36,783","00:03:38,282","<i>just 'cause the streets</i>
<i>are so narrow.</i>
"
5,0,57,"00:03:38,284","00:03:40,004","<i>It's just one of the
challenges that we face</i>
"
5,0,58,"00:03:40,036","00:03:41,952","filming in a city like this.
"
5,0,59,"00:03:50,129","00:03:52,546","<i>You can't take vehicles</i>
<i>within the old walls,</i>
"
5,0,60,"00:03:52,582","00:03:55,466","<i>so everything has</i>
<i>to get taken by Sherpas</i>
"
5,0,61,"00:03:55,501","00:03:58,135","<i>up to a location today</i>
<i>which is probably</i>
"
5,0,62,"00:03:58,171","00:04:01,338","<i>one of the furthest and trickiest
you could get to in the whole city.</i>
"
5,0,63,"00:04:01,390","00:04:03,224","A little rule that I have
for myself on location,
"
5,0,64,"00:04:03,259","00:04:05,976","and this is never go up empty-handed
or come down empty-handed.
"
5,0,65,"00:04:06,012","00:04:09,263","<i>Now it's just a load of stairs</i>

"
5,0,67,"00:04:11,184","00:04:12,650","Good. Good, good.

"
5,0,70,"00:04:17,356","00:04:19,607","<i>They will do a rehearsal</i>

"
5,0,71,"00:04:19,659","00:04:21,775","<i>and then they'll do</i>

"
5,0,72,"00:04:21,828","00:04:24,862","<i>which is when they'll place where the cameras

Nice to see you.
"
5,0,75,"00:04:38,294","00:04:40,511","<i>Episode one and
two have been in Croatia.</i>
"
5,0,76,"00:04:40,546","00:04:43,097","They've done most of their filming
and they're back here finishing up
"
5,0,77,"00:04:43,132","00:04:45,799","now that Emilia
has finished in Croatia.
"
5,0,78,"00:04:47,887","00:04:50,137","Do that. Just growl at one point.
"
5,0,79,"00:04:50,189","00:04:53,858","So this morning, episode one and
two with Mike Slovis directing
"
5,0,80,"00:04:53,893","00:04:57,895","are setting up to do their first scene
this season in Dany's penthouse.
"
5,0,81,"00:04:57,947","00:05:00,314","Morning, everybody.
Hello.
"
5,0,82,"00:05:00,366","00:05:03,817","<i>So it's right at the
beginning of the-- season five</i>
"
5,0,83,"00:05:03,870","00:05:06,453","and it's the first time
Dany gets an inkling
"
5,0,84,"00:05:06,489","00:05:09,406","of what's going on in Meereen
under her new rule.
"
5,0,85,"00:05:09,458","00:05:11,825","And then do you want it
to be a boom,
"
5,0,86,"00:05:11,878","00:05:14,662","I've decided
I will not have them?
"
5,0,87,"00:05:14,714","00:05:16,247","Or do you want it
to be kind of like--
"
5,0,88,"00:05:16,249","00:05:17,882","- No, I think it's more gentle.
- It's gentle?
"
5,0,89,"00:05:17,917","00:05:19,583","It is gentle?
Okay, lovely. Yeah.
"
5,0,90,"00:05:19,635","00:05:21,752","I have shot mostly in Belfast.
"
5,0,91,"00:05:21,754","00:05:24,922","I have shot several days
in Croatia
"
5,0,92,"00:05:24,974","00:05:27,591","and I am going to shoot
in Seville.
"
5,0,93,"00:05:27,643","00:05:29,426","Teach them a better way.
"
5,0,94,"00:05:29,428","00:05:31,095","It sounds like something
Jorah would have said.
"
5,0,95,"00:05:31,097","00:05:33,264","<i>Moving to a foreign
country on this show</i>
"
5,0,96,"00:05:33,316","00:05:36,016","is not as disruptive
as you might think
"
5,0,97,"00:05:36,068","00:05:38,102","because one of the two crews
"
5,0,98,"00:05:38,154","00:05:41,322","that you've already
worked with here goes there.
"
5,0,99,"00:05:41,357","00:05:43,357","<i>So the first thing that happens</i>
<i>when you walk on the set</i>
"
5,0,100,"00:05:43,442","00:05:44,942","<i>is that you see familiar faces.</i>
"
5,0,101,"00:05:44,994","00:05:48,362","<i>My priority today
is looking after Emilia</i>
"
5,0,102,"00:05:48,414","00:05:50,281","because she's come from Croatia,
"
5,0,103,"00:05:50,333","00:05:52,950","so we're matching continuity
to that country.
"
5,0,104,"00:05:53,002","00:05:54,919","<i>They send their photos to us</i>
"
5,0,105,"00:05:54,954","00:05:57,454","<i>so that we can do the same</i>
<i>as they've been doing.</i>
"
5,0,106,"00:05:57,456","00:05:59,757","<i>There's two
departments filming at the same time,</i>
"
5,0,107,"00:05:59,792","00:06:01,592","so it's imperative
that things like wigs,
"
5,0,108,"00:06:01,627","00:06:05,129","continuity photos
all travel together
"
5,0,109,"00:06:05,181","00:06:08,132","and that every member of the team
is aware of what the look is,
"
5,0,110,"00:06:08,134","00:06:10,301","<i>because if we do have to
take over someone's artist,</i>
"
5,0,111,"00:06:10,353","00:06:13,304","we know exactly what we're
doing and there's no mess-ups
"
5,0,112,"00:06:13,306","00:06:15,389","when we're watching
the show, hopefully.
"
5,0,113,"00:06:15,441","00:06:17,107","<i>Let's do one
for camera, please.</i>
"
5,0,114,"00:06:17,143","00:06:18,776","Okay.
"
5,0,115,"00:06:18,811","00:06:21,145","<i>Let's have it quiet
for rehearsal, please.</i>
"
5,0,116,"00:06:21,147","00:06:23,731","<i>And that means everybody</i>
<i>in here, thank you.</i>
"
5,0,117,"00:06:23,783","00:06:25,115","<i>Action.</i>
"
5,0,118,"00:06:25,151","00:06:26,650","So the only thing
that gave him pride
"
5,0,119,"00:06:26,652","00:06:29,153","was knowing there was
someone lower than he was.
"
5,0,120,"00:06:39,832","00:06:42,299","- Morning.
- Morning.
"
5,0,121,"00:06:42,335","00:06:43,684","- How are you?

Yeah, no, I'm talking with him.
"
5,0,125,"00:06:51,861","00:06:53,894","About Crdoba bridge
and the drone.
"
5,0,126,"00:06:53,946","00:06:56,146","<i>As far as I'm concerned,
Bernie is ""Game of Thrones.""</i>
"
5,0,127,"00:06:56,148","00:06:59,283","I've never met a producer that cares
for a crew as much as she does.
"
5,0,128,"00:06:59,318","00:07:02,069","She's an incredible woman
to work for, actually,
"
5,0,129,"00:07:02,121","00:07:03,654","and everybody loves her.
"
5,0,130,"00:07:03,706","00:07:05,027","<i>And she keeps</i>
<i>everything together.</i>
"
5,0,131,"00:07:05,041","00:07:06,824","And do they want to
clear a place in that?
"
5,0,132,"00:07:06,876","00:07:08,409","So the bridge has to be closed.
"
5,0,133,"00:07:08,461","00:07:09,910","That's--
I'm checking on.
"
5,0,134,"00:07:09,962","00:07:12,246","Along with David and Dan,
she's the executive producer.
"
5,0,135,"00:07:12,298","00:07:14,631","David and Dan are obviously-- you
know, they're the creators of it.

<i>what the scene might be,</i>
"
5,0,141,"00:07:25,678","00:07:28,429","will watch rehearsal,
give their notes on the scene,
"
5,0,142,"00:07:28,481","00:07:31,065","and then a lot of times we're
discussing what is in advance.

5,0,143,"00:07:31,100","00:07:32,983","As you can imagine,
with 10 episodes,
"
5,0,144,"00:07:33,019","00:07:34,535","that we're constantly prepping.

5,0,145,"00:07:34,587","00:07:39,256","Much like our characters, we
will go from the amazing Daznak

5,0,179,"00:09:11,233","00:09:13,400","<i>It is difficult
to shoot in a place like that</i>

5,0,180,"00:09:13,436","00:09:16,854","because it was obviously
not built as a set,

5,0,181,"00:09:16,856","00:09:19,189","but built for a purpose,
a different purpose than ours.

5,0,182,"00:09:23,629","00:09:26,580","Some of the places, as you see
in the balcony, for instance,
"
5,0,183,"00:09:26,615","00:09:29,533","I mean, you can't possibly
get some of the gear up there

- Okay.
"
5,0,189,"00:09:55,110","00:09:57,644","<i>It's not like</i>

shooting day is up here.
"
5,0,191,"00:09:59,732","00:10:01,231","And then we move down
to the garden.
"
5,0,192,"00:10:01,283","00:10:03,150","We'll get control of the
garden, I'm assuming?
"
5,0,193,"00:10:03,202","00:10:06,904","As far as you told me, we have the

gonna be a challenge
"
5,0,198,"00:10:19,919","00:10:22,920","because you're in a new place
both culturally and logistically.
"
5,0,199,"00:10:22,972","00:10:24,505","We'll have to find a compromise

5,0,208,"00:10:42,608","00:10:44,858","It's never been locked off
like this for anybody.
"
5,0,209,"00:10:44,910","00:10:46,443","All right, so will you go
and check the others?
"
5,0,210,"00:10:46,495","00:10:49,413","- Sure. - Because I think
we're running a bit late now.
"
5,0,211,"00:10:59,041","00:11:03,126","We're now driving up to a little
village called Magheramorne
"
5,0,212,"00:11:03,178","00:11:07,464","in which there is a quarry that's
been there for a number of years now.

5,0,213,"00:11:07,516","00:11:09,633","<i>And in season one</i>
"
5,0,214,"00:11:09,685","00:11:12,135","<i>we built the set</i>

"
5,0,215,"00:11:12,137","00:11:13,804","<i>Because there's a lake</i>
<i>in the quarry,</i>
"
5,0,216,"00:11:13,856","00:11:16,356","<i>in season two we built the
battlements of King's Landing</i>
"
5,0,217,"00:11:16,392","00:11:17,975","<i>for the Battle of Blackwater</i>
"

"
5,0,219,"00:11:19,979","00:11:23,647","<i>It's still standing, although it's
looking a bit worn these days.</i>
"
5,0,220,"00:11:23,649","00:11:27,484","Now we're driving up to have a
look at a set mid-construction

5,0,221,"00:11:27,536","00:11:29,486","<i>of a fishing village</i>
<i>set north of the Wall.</i>
"

taking shape this morning.</i>
"
5,0,223,"00:11:33,959","00:11:35,659","<i>The set that we see down here,</i>
"
5,0,224,"00:11:35,661","00:11:38,629","<i>it's a fishing village that is
a protected fishing village.</i>
"
5,0,225,"00:11:38,664","00:11:40,414","<i>It's not a military</i>
<i>establishment.</i>
"
5,0,226,"00:11:40,466","00:11:43,133","It was designed to be
somewhere where people
"
5,0,227,"00:11:43,168","00:11:44,885","had a living off the sea.
"
5,0,228,"00:11:44,920","00:11:47,137","<i>So we needed the water,</i>
<i>which is why we put it</i>
"
5,0,229,"00:11:47,172","00:11:49,806","<i>on the edge</i>
<i>of the reservoir here.</i>
"
5,0,230,"00:11:49,842","00:11:51,808","The fantastic thing
about the Hardhome set
"
5,0,231,"00:11:51,844","00:11:56,346","is we're building something
that is so far north this time
"
5,0,232,"00:11:56,348","00:11:58,732","<i>that what we get to do</i>
<i>is create a fishing village</i>
"
5,0,233,"00:11:58,767","00:12:00,851","<i>that is exactly</i>
<i>as the name describes.</i>
"
5,0,234,"00:12:00,853","00:12:02,936","<i>It's Hardhome.</i>
<i>What we've been doing</i>
"
5,0,235,"00:12:02,988","00:12:05,022","<i>both in concepts and in models</i>
"
5,0,236,"00:12:05,074","00:12:08,692","<i>is looking at the location</i>
<i>out in Magheramorne</i>
"
5,0,237,"00:12:08,744","00:12:10,661","and created what we need
for the action,
"
5,0,238,"00:12:10,696","00:12:14,498","which is a longhouse in which
a lot of action takes place.
"
5,0,239,"00:12:14,533","00:12:16,366","<i>And then we have</i>
<i>the landing area,</i>
"
5,0,240,"00:12:16,368","00:12:19,369","<i>which we're able to use the lake
that exists in Magheramorne.</i>
"
5,0,241,"00:12:19,421","00:12:23,507","And so through having those
sort of necessary requirements,
"
5,0,242,"00:12:23,542","00:12:26,510","we can then build
this sort of tent city
"
5,0,243,"00:12:26,545","00:12:28,462","<i>that will be created out there.</i>
"
5,0,244,"00:12:28,514","00:12:30,714","So I had this good idea,
"
5,0,245,"00:12:30,716","00:12:32,883","which I need to pitch, I guess,
"
5,0,246,"00:12:32,885","00:12:36,053","which is to hold onto that shot.
"
5,0,247,"00:12:36,055","00:12:39,389","<i>The director can
now see the bones of the whole set,</i>
"
5,0,248,"00:12:39,441","00:12:42,809","<i>so he's gonna walk through</i>
<i>the set and start mapping out</i>
"
5,0,249,"00:12:42,861","00:12:45,879","<i>where all the things that</i>
<i>he's imagined will take place.</i>
"
5,0,250,"00:12:45,914","00:12:48,665","If the plan to do that shot--
it's the boater's point of view,
"
5,0,251,"00:12:48,667","00:12:49,750","so it's looking
through the fence.
"
5,0,252,"00:12:49,802","00:12:51,168","<i>So anything at this point</i>
"
5,0,253,"00:12:51,170","00:12:53,220","<i>that the director</i>
<i>would like to change,</i>
"
5,0,254,"00:12:53,255","00:12:55,472","<i>this is the time that he has</i>
<i>to turn around and say,</i>
"
5,0,255,"00:12:55,507","00:12:57,724","<i>""Well, could I put the door</i>
<i>in the hut over here?""</i>
"
5,0,256,"00:12:57,760","00:13:01,011","<i>and, ""Could I have this</i>
<i>a bit higher?"" or so on.</i>
"
5,0,257,"00:13:01,013","00:13:03,547","Good, so, yeah,
we good with this?
"
5,0,258,"00:13:03,582","00:13:06,316","- Yeah.
- Rock and roll, so...
"
5,0,259,"00:13:06,352","00:13:09,232","- shall we have a look... - Look at this edge
here and see if that works.

5,0,260,"00:13:09,254","00:13:11,038","<i>""Game of
Thrones"" is a big event,</i>
"
5,0,261,"00:13:11,090","00:13:12,622","and what you mustn't do
"
5,0,262,"00:13:12,675","00:13:16,293","is get put off
by the bigness of it.
"
5,0,263,"00:13:16,295","00:13:18,845","The thing to do

with the Valyrian language in,

5,0,421,"00:21:16,374","00:21:18,124","it was just the place
they were looking for.

5,0,435,"00:21:54,396","00:21:56,312","<i>It was just incredible.</i>

"
5,0,442,"00:22:19,054","00:22:22,388","And then, of course, we had the big
trip out to see the set of Hardhome

5,0,458,"00:23:02,013","00:23:05,148","And obviously trying to set up
Spain at the same time.

5,0,459,"00:23:05,183","00:23:06,649","Yeah.
"
5,0,460,"00:23:06,685","00:23:08,851","And getting through
every day of filming.

5,1,304,"00:26:19,464","00:26:21,838","So where are we going?
"
5,1,305,"00:26:21,839","00:26:24,255","To a land where
you trust everyone?
"
5,1,306,"00:26:24,256","00:26:27,005","To a land so far from here,
"
5,1,307,"00:26:27,006","00:26:28,926","even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.
"
5,1,308,"00:26:37,797","00:26:40,881","It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.
"
5,1,309,"00:26:44,422","00:26:45,588","Your father was a--
"
5,1,310,"00:26:45,589","00:26:48,546","a force to be reckoned with.
"
5,1,311,"00:26:48,547","00:26:49,755","He truly was.
"
5,1,312,"00:26:49,756","00:26:52,921","I wouldn't presume to claim
"
5,1,313,"00:26:52,922","00:26:55,255","to have known him
as such, but--
"
5,1,314,"00:26:55,256","00:26:58,796","<i>but just being in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>
"
5,1,315,"00:26:58,797","00:27:00,963","just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.
"
5,1,316,"00:27:00,964","00:27:04,338","What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.
"
5,1,317,"00:27:06,881","00:27:09,256","Thank you so much
for your kind words.
"
5,1,318,"00:27:13,922","00:27:16,463","Deepest condolences, Your Grace.
"
5,1,319,"00:27:16,464","00:27:18,505","This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.
"
5,1,320,"00:27:18,506","00:27:21,547","I often warned...

"
5,1,322,"00:27:29,131","00:27:31,630","Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.
"
5,1,323,"00:27:31,631","00:27:33,921","My deepest sympathies.
"
5,1,324,"00:27:33,922","00:27:37,046","I apologize
for my son's appearance.
"
5,1,325,"00:27:37,047","00:27:38,168","Uncle, it's quite all right.

5,1,326,"00:27:41,589","00:27:43,630","They call themselves sparrows.
"
5,1,327,"00:27:43,631","00:27:46,338","Bloody fanatics.
"
5,1,328,"00:27:46,339","00:27:48,338","Religion has its place,
of course,
"
5,1,329,"00:27:48,339","00:27:51,171","but at a certain point...
"
5,1,330,"00:27:51,172","00:27:54,130","They never would have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.
"
5,1,331,"00:27:54,131","00:27:55,796","I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
"
5,1,332,"00:27:55,797","00:27:57,796","whatever it is.
"
5,1,333,"00:27:57,797","00:28:00,339","- Excuse me.
- Of course.
"
5,1,334,"00:28:18,756","00:28:21,463","Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.
"
5,1,335,"00:28:21,464","00:28:23,839","It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.
"
5,1,336,"00:28:26,547","00:28:29,464","What can I do for you?
"
5,1,337,"00:28:30,464","00:28:32,713","You can forgive me.
"
5,1,338,"00:28:32,714","00:28:35,546","What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?
"
5,1,339,"00:28:35,547","00:28:38,255","I led you into the darkness.
"
5,1,340,"00:28:38,256","00:28:39,671","I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.
"
5,1,341,"00:28:39,672","00:28:42,463","I tempted you into our...
"
5,1,342,"00:28:42,464","00:28:45,714","unnatural relations.
"
5,1,343,"00:28:47,256","00:28:49,714","And, of course,
there was the king...

5,1,344,"00:28:51,297","00:28:54,131","his boar hunt.
"
5,1,345,"00:28:56,131","00:28:57,214","His wine.
"
5,1,346,"00:29:00,881","00:29:02,755","I don't know what
you're talking about.
"
5,1,347,"00:29:02,756","00:29:06,006","I'm a different person now.
"
5,1,348,"00:29:07,797","00:29:10,546","I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

"
5,1,350,"00:29:12,214","00:29:13,838","<i>They watch over all of us,</i>

"
5,1,354,"00:29:26,381","00:29:28,046","I will pray for
your father's soul.

- It doesn't.
"
5,1,357,"00:29:45,506","00:29:48,421","It does.
"
5,1,358,"00:29:48,422","00:29:52,547","That's the--
that's the Sunspear bit right there.
"
5,1,359,"00:29:53,756","00:29:55,463","And that's where
the mountains are.
"
5,1,360,"00:29:55,464","00:29:58,796","And over here is--

5,1,361,"00:29:58,797","00:30:01,588","is Sunsnake?
"
5,1,362,"00:30:01,589","00:30:02,213","Stonespear?

5,1,363,"00:30:02,214","00:30:04,713","Sandstone.
"
5,1,364,"00:30:04,714","00:30:06,296","Yes.
"
5,1,365,"00:30:06,297","00:30:08,713","Yes, Sandstone.
"
5,1,366,"00:30:10,131","00:30:11,463","Just there.
"
5,1,367,"00:30:11,464","00:30:13,464","Fine.
"
5,1,368,"00:30:16,172","00:30:16,839","It's Dorne.
"
5,1,369,"00:30:19,131","00:30:21,338","We should go there.
"
5,1,370,"00:30:21,339","00:30:23,713","I think we would
have a lovely time,
"
5,1,371,"00:30:23,714","00:30:26,088","judging by my experience.
"
5,1,372,"00:30:26,089","00:30:30,838","That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.
"
5,1,373,"00:30:30,839","00:30:32,381","Anywhere but here.
"
5,1,374,"00:30:41,506","00:30:43,422","We're late for dinner as it is.
"
5,1,375,"00:30:44,214","00:30:45,838","You're very respectful.
"
5,1,376,"00:30:45,839","00:30:46,714","I'm very hungry.
"
5,1,377,"00:31:04,381","00:31:07,171","What's your name?
"
5,1,378,"00:31:07,172","00:31:08,838","Olyvar, my lady.
"
5,1,379,"00:31:08,839","00:31:10,671","I'm afraid my brother
"
5,1,380,"00:31:10,672","00:31:14,131","is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.
"
5,1,381,"00:31:23,006","00:31:24,839","My lady.
"
5,1,382,"00:31:37,339","00:31:41,088","Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?
"
5,1,383,"00:31:41,089","00:31:42,838","Why?
"
5,1,384,"00:31:42,839","00:31:45,171","They all know about me anyway.
"
5,1,385,"00:31:45,172","00:31:48,463","Everybody knows everything
about everyone.
"
5,1,386,"00:31:48,464","00:31:51,630","What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?
"
5,1,387,"00:31:51,631","00:31:54,922","In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.
"
5,1,388,"00:31:55,631","00:31:58,338","My intended?
Please.
"
5,1,389,"00:31:58,339","00:31:59,755","<i>Tywin's dead.</i>
"
5,1,390,"00:31:59,756","00:32:02,171","<i>That means no one</i>

- Unlucky you.
"
5,1,392,"00:32:04,381","00:32:05,838","You think I want that woman
married to my brother?
"
5,1,393,"00:32:05,839","00:32:09,921","If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.
"
5,1,394,"00:32:09,922","00:32:12,630","Which means she stays
in King's Landing.
"
5,1,395,"00:32:12,631","00:32:15,213","<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>
"
5,1,396,"00:32:15,214","00:32:16,797","Perhaps.
"
5,1,397,"00:32:18,839","00:32:20,880","Perhaps?
"
5,1,398,"00:32:20,881","00:32:21,714","Perhaps.

Master of Whisperers.

"
5,1,404,"00:32:51,047","00:32:52,797","but not a coward.
"
5,1,405,"00:32:56,756","00:32:59,130","You never told me
why you set me free.
"
5,1,406,"00:32:59,131","00:33:02,130","Your brother asked me to.
"
5,1,407,"00:33:02,131","00:33:03,380","Could have said no.
"
5,1,408,"00:33:03,381","00:33:06,630","Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.
"
5,1,409,"00:33:06,631","00:33:08,880","Not as dangerous
as releasing me.
"
5,1,410,"00:33:08,881","00:33:11,588","You risked your life,
your position, everything.
"
5,1,411,"00:33:11,589","00:33:14,255","Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.
"
5,1,412,"00:33:14,256","00:33:15,838","I didn't do it for you.
"
5,1,413,"00:33:15,839","00:33:18,880","I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
"
5,1,414,"00:33:18,881","00:33:22,130","A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.
"
5,1,415,"00:33:22,131","00:33:24,380","I don't believe in saviors.
"
5,1,416,"00:33:24,381","00:33:27,756","I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

admirable qualities,
"
5,1,420,"00:33:38,464","00:33:39,838","self-pity is not
one of them.

5,1,421,"00:33:39,839","00:33:42,130","Any fool with a bit of luck
"
5,1,422,"00:33:42,131","00:33:45,671","can find himself
born into power.
"
5,1,423,"00:33:45,672","00:33:49,338","But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.
"
5,1,424,"00:33:49,339","00:33:51,880","I'm not well-suited
for work.

5,1,426,"00:33:53,506","00:33:55,588","You have your father's
instincts for politics.

"
5,1,429,"00:34:00,381","00:34:03,005","I killed my lover

are made of gingerbread

5,1,468,"00:36:02,547","00:36:04,963","the freed men and
the former slaveholders.
"
5,1,469,"00:36:04,964","00:36:07,088","All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.
"
5,1,470,"00:36:07,089","00:36:08,838","Good.
"
5,1,471,"00:36:08,839","00:36:11,380","They did ask
for some concessions.
"
5,1,472,"00:36:11,381","00:36:13,130","Concessions?
"
5,1,473,"00:36:13,131","00:36:16,213","Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.
"
5,1,474,"00:36:16,214","00:36:19,130","I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.
"
5,1,475,"00:36:19,131","00:36:22,380","<i>Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>
"
5,1,476,"00:36:22,381","00:36:26,796","Still, it's easier to rule happy
subjects than angry ones.
"
5,1,477,"00:36:26,797","00:36:28,796","I don't expect
the Wise Masters to be happy.
"
5,1,478,"00:36:28,797","00:36:31,171","Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.
"
5,1,479,"00:36:31,172","00:36:34,255","They do not ask
for the return of slavery.
"
5,1,480,"00:36:34,256","00:36:36,839","They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.
"
5,1,481,"00:36:38,756","00:36:40,505","The fighting pits?
"
5,1,482,"00:36:40,506","00:36:42,005","Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?
"
5,1,483,"00:36:42,006","00:36:44,880","In the new world
that you've brought to us,
"
5,1,484,"00:36:44,881","00:36:47,214","free men would fight free men.
"
5,1,485,"00:36:48,714","00:36:50,130","<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>
"
5,1,486,"00:36:50,131","00:36:52,213","<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>
"
5,1,487,"00:36:52,214","00:36:54,546","Bring some here
and ask them yourself.
"
5,1,488,"00:36:54,547","00:36:55,755","No fighting pits.
"
5,1,489,"00:36:55,756","00:36:57,088","Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai
"
5,1,490,"00:36:57,089","00:37:00,046","and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.
"
5,1,491,"00:37:00,047","00:37:02,463","I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.
"
5,1,492,"00:37:02,464","00:37:05,714","- If you-- - How many times must I say no
before you understand?
"
5,1,493,"00:37:08,131","00:37:11,505","Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.
"
5,1,494,"00:37:11,506","00:37:14,046","If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...
"
5,1,495,"00:37:14,047","00:37:16,213","You should reopen
the fighting pits.
"
5,1,496,"00:37:16,214","00:37:19,088","What?
"
5,1,497,"00:37:19,089","00:37:20,714","My mother was a whore.
I told you that.
"
5,1,498,"00:37:22,797","00:37:25,463","She liked to drink pear brandy.
"
5,1,499,"00:37:25,464","00:37:29,546","The older she got, the less
she made selling her body,
"
5,1,500,"00:37:29,547","00:37:31,921","the more she wanted to drink.
"
5,1,501,"00:37:31,922","00:37:35,130","So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver
"
5,1,502,"00:37:35,131","00:37:37,755","she fucked the night before.
"
5,1,503,"00:37:37,756","00:37:40,046","I'm sorry.
"
5,1,504,"00:37:40,047","00:37:42,796","Why?
I was a bad child.
"
5,1,505,"00:37:42,797","00:37:45,588","I wasn't big, but I was quick.
"
5,1,506,"00:37:45,589","00:37:47,880","And I loved to fight.
"
5,1,507,"00:37:47,881","00:37:49,880","So they sold me
to a man in Tolos
"
5,1,508,"00:37:49,881","00:37:52,046","who trained fighters
for the pits.
"
5,1,509,"00:37:52,047","00:37:54,671","I had my first match
when I was 16.
"
5,1,510,"00:37:54,672","00:37:56,838","You were sold into slavery,
"
5,1,511,"00:37:56,839","00:37:59,296","forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,
"
5,1,512,"00:37:59,297","00:38:00,817","and you're defending
the fighting pits?
"
5,1,513,"00:38:02,506","00:38:05,296","I'm only here
because of those pits.
"
5,1,514,"00:38:05,297","00:38:07,921","I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,
"
5,1,515,"00:38:07,922","00:38:09,338","a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.
"
5,1,516,"00:38:09,339","00:38:11,963","Soon I was famous.
"
5,1,517,"00:38:11,964","00:38:14,213","10,000 men and women
screamed my name
"
5,1,518,"00:38:14,214","00:38:15,296","when I stepped into the pit.
"
5,1,519,"00:38:15,297","00:38:16,796","I made so much money
for my master,
"
5,1,520,"00:38:16,797","00:38:19,588","he set me free when he died.
"
5,1,521,"00:38:19,589","00:38:21,380","I joined the Second Sons.
"
5,1,522,"00:38:21,381","00:38:24,297","And then I met you.
"
5,1,523,"00:38:29,797","00:38:31,130","You're the queen.
"
5,1,524,"00:38:31,131","00:38:34,671","Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.
"
5,1,525,"00:38:34,672","00:38:37,255","Everyone but me.
"
5,1,526,"00:38:37,256","00:38:41,463","You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.
"
5,1,527,"00:38:41,464","00:38:44,255","As soon as they see weakness,
"
5,1,528,"00:38:44,256","00:38:46,505","they'll attack.
"
5,1,529,"00:38:46,506","00:38:50,046","Show your strength here, now.
"
5,1,530,"00:38:50,047","00:38:52,208","That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.
"
5,1,531,"00:38:54,422","00:38:57,963","Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
"
5,1,532,"00:38:57,964","00:39:01,713","You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.
"
5,1,533,"00:39:01,714","00:39:02,874","You're the Mother of Dragons.
"
5,1,534,"00:39:10,547","00:39:14,422","I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.
"
5,1,535,"00:39:15,422","00:39:18,296","No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
"
5,1,536,"00:39:18,297","00:39:20,756","For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.
"
5,1,537,"00:39:25,714","00:39:27,839","I can't control them anymore.
"
5,1,538,"00:39:29,256","00:39:32,796","A dragon queen with no dragons
"
5,1,539,"00:39:32,797","00:39:33,922","is not a queen.
"
5,1,540,"00:40:40,339","00:40:42,631","Viserion?
"
5,1,541,"00:40:44,631","00:40:46,506","Rhaegal?
"
5,1,542,"00:40:58,506","00:41:00,046","Easy. Easy.
"
5,1,543,"00:41:00,047","00:41:02,213","Easy.
"
5,1,544,"00:41:41,631","00:41:43,838","So here we are.
"
5,1,545,"00:41:43,839","00:41:44,922","Here we are.
"
5,1,546,"00:41:47,714","00:41:51,505","When we first met,
you were my prisoner.
"
5,1,547,"00:41:51,506","00:41:53,714","And now, for our last meeting...
"
5,1,548,"00:41:56,047","00:41:59,505","This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.
"
5,1,549,"00:41:59,506","00:42:01,922","No, but it will be.
"
5,1,550,"00:42:04,464","00:42:06,796","You know what Stannis wants?
"
5,1,551,"00:42:06,797","00:42:09,338","He wants me to bend the knee.
"
5,1,552,"00:42:09,339","00:42:11,713","And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.
"
5,1,553,"00:42:11,714","00:42:14,921","I'll give him this much,
"
5,1,554,"00:42:14,922","00:42:16,255","he's bold.
"
5,1,555,"00:42:16,256","00:42:17,796","Shouldn't a king be bold?
"
5,1,556,"00:42:17,797","00:42:19,880","<i>Oh, aye.</i>
"
5,1,557,"00:42:19,881","00:42:23,005","I respect him.
"
5,1,558,"00:42:23,006","00:42:24,546","If he gets what he wants,
"
5,1,559,"00:42:24,547","00:42:26,255","I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools
"
5,1,560,"00:42:26,256","00:42:30,171","sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.
"
5,1,561,"00:42:30,172","00:42:32,631","But I'll never serve him.
"
5,1,562,"00:42:33,881","00:42:35,671","You told me you weren't
here to conquer.
"
5,1,563,"00:42:35,672","00:42:37,005","You told me your people
have bled enough.
"
5,1,564,"00:42:37,006","00:42:38,630","That's right.
"
5,1,565,"00:42:38,631","00:42:41,921","I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.
"
5,1,566,"00:42:41,922","00:42:45,380","You spent your life convincing
90 clans to come together
"
5,1,567,"00:42:45,381","00:42:46,463","for the first time in history.
"
5,1,568,"00:42:46,464","00:42:49,630","Thenns and Hornfoots,
"
5,1,569,"00:42:49,631","00:42:52,713","the ice-river clans,
even the giants.
"
5,1,570,"00:42:52,714","00:42:55,713","A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.
"
5,1,571,"00:42:55,714","00:42:59,088","You didn't do it for glory.
"
5,1,572,"00:42:59,089","00:43:01,255","You brought them
together to save them
"
5,1,573,"00:43:01,256","00:43:02,796","<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>
"
5,1,574,"00:43:02,797","00:43:04,671","<i>not if they're north</i>

"
5,1,575,"00:43:04,672","00:43:06,671","Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?
"
5,1,576,"00:43:06,672","00:43:08,506","Pride?
"
5,1,577,"00:43:10,672","00:43:13,214","Fuck my pride.
"
5,1,578,"00:43:14,506","00:43:16,797","This isn't about that.
"
5,1,579,"00:43:19,297","00:43:21,922","Then bend the knee
and save your people.
"
5,1,580,"00:43:24,797","00:43:28,046","They followed me
because they respected me.
"
5,1,581,"00:43:28,047","00:43:30,005","Because they believed in me.
"
5,1,582,"00:43:30,006","00:43:32,380","The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.
"
5,1,583,"00:43:32,381","00:43:35,671","And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?
"
5,1,584,"00:43:35,672","00:43:38,921","How many women?
How many children?
"
5,1,585,"00:43:38,922","00:43:41,963","And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?
"
5,1,586,"00:43:41,964","00:43:44,171","You're afraid of looking afraid.
"
5,1,587,"00:43:44,172","00:43:47,006","Oh, I am afraid.
"
5,1,588,"00:43:47,631","00:43:49,797","No shame in that.
"
5,1,589,"00:43:59,172","00:44:03,088","How will they do it?
Beheading?
"
5,1,590,"00:44:03,089","00:44:04,964","Hanging?
"
5,1,591,"00:44:07,672","00:44:10,256","They'll burn you alive.
"
5,1,592,"00:44:14,922","00:44:16,714","Bad way to go.
"
5,1,593,"00:44:20,839","00:44:22,671","I'll be honest with you.
"
5,1,594,"00:44:22,672","00:44:24,671","I don't want to die.
"
5,1,595,"00:44:24,672","00:44:26,838","And burnt to death,
"
5,1,596,"00:44:26,839","00:44:28,796","I don't want people
to remember me like that,
"
5,1,597,"00:44:28,797","00:44:30,671","scorched and screaming.
"
5,1,598,"00:44:30,672","00:44:33,463","But it's better than betraying
"
5,1,599,"00:44:33,464","00:44:35,171","everything I believe.
"
5,1,600,"00:44:35,172","00:44:37,630","And what happens to your people?
"
5,1,601,"00:44:37,631","00:44:41,380","You preserve your dignity
and die standing
"
5,1,602,"00:44:41,381","00:44:43,796","and they'll sing
songs about you.
"
5,1,603,"00:44:43,797","00:44:45,255","You'd rather burn than kneel.
"
5,1,604,"00:44:45,256","00:44:46,922","The great hero.
"
5,1,605,"00:44:49,756","00:44:52,630","Until winter comes and
the white walkers come for us all

5,1,606,"00:44:52,631","00:44:55,297","and there's no one left to sing.

5,1,608,"00:44:59,297","00:45:02,463","Truly you are.
"
5,1,609,"00:45:02,464","00:45:07,505","But if you can't understand why I won't

5,1,611,"00:45:10,256","00:45:12,256","there's no point explaining.

5,1,613,"00:45:32,672","00:45:35,213","The freedom to make
my own mistakes

5,2,2,"00:02:08,269","00:02:11,724","In old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,
"
5,2,3,"00:02:11,844","00:02:15,516","the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,
"
5,2,4,"00:02:15,636","00:02:19,531","wade into the sea and smash the enemies.
"
5,2,5,"00:02:20,391","00:02:22,877","It's just a statue.
"
5,2,6,"00:02:25,777","00:02:31,502","Haha. Don't be afraid. He's
announcing our arrival.
"
5,2,7,"00:02:32,543","00:02:36,260","I'm not afraid.
"
5,2,8,"00:03:42,861","00:03:45,775","The House of Black and White.
"
5,2,9,"00:03:45,895","00:03:49,404","This is where you'll find
the man you seek.
"
5,2,10,"00:03:53,568","00:03:57,018","Here, I leave you.
"
5,2,11,"00:04:03,981","00:04:08,141","- Thank you for bringing me.
- Any man in Braavos would have done the same.
"
5,2,12,"00:04:09,925","00:04:13,732","- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.
"
5,2,13,"00:04:49,053","00:04:51,021","Hello.
"
5,2,14,"00:04:53,698","00:04:56,494","Valar morghulis.
"
5,2,15,"00:05:06,334","00:05:08,925","Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
"
5,2,16,"00:05:12,399","00:05:16,595","- No one here by that name.
- Please!
"
5,2,17,"00:05:16,715","00:05:20,105","I've crossed the narrow sea.
I have nowhere else to go.
"
5,2,18,"00:05:20,225","00:05:24,863","- You have everywhere else to go.
- But wait!

"
5,2,36,"00:07:09,546","00:07:12,134","Ale?
"
5,2,37,"00:07:18,533","00:07:20,475","Ale?
"
5,2,38,"00:07:28,273","00:07:31,414","Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven's scroll.
"
5,2,39,"00:07:33,936","00:07:36,648","You are becoming an observant young lady.
"
5,2,40,"00:07:36,768","00:07:39,431","My mother used to say ""dark wings dark words"".
"
5,2,41,"00:07:39,551","00:07:43,310","An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
"
5,2,42,"00:07:45,690","00:07:47,688","So it's good news.
"
5,2,43,"00:07:47,808","00:07:50,163","My marriage proposal has been accepted.
"
5,2,44,"00:07:50,283","00:07:52,970","I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
"
5,2,45,"00:07:53,090","00:07:56,111","- Ale?
- I'll have some.
"
5,2,46,"00:07:59,536","00:08:02,239","My Lady...
"
5,2,47,"00:08:02,359","00:08:05,513","- What is it?
- Sansa Stark. Don't look!
"
5,2,48,"00:08:06,992","00:08:07,899","You sure?
"
5,2,49,"00:08:08,019","00:08:09,475","She's dyed her hair, but it's her.
"
5,2,50,"00:08:09,595","00:08:11,202","She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.
"
5,2,51,"00:08:11,322","00:08:12,240","Littlefinger?
"
5,2,52,"00:08:12,360","00:08:13,852","A bunch of knights with them.
"
5,2,53,"00:08:13,972","00:08:16,085","Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?
"
5,2,54,"00:08:16,205","00:08:17,594","Ten, I think. Too many.
"
5,2,55,"00:08:18,321","00:08:19,642","My Lady, I don't think this is...
"
5,2,56,"00:08:19,726","00:08:21,015","Ready the horses!
"
5,2,57,"00:08:21,135","00:08:22,653","We only have one horse.
"
5,2,58,"00:08:22,877","00:08:24,087","Find more!
"
5,2,59,"00:08:30,314","00:08:31,561","Do you like the taste?
"
5,2,60,"00:08:32,347","00:08:34,280","Don't see what all the fuss is about.
"
5,2,61,"00:08:35,004","00:08:37,337","Why do men love it so much?
"
5,2,62,"00:08:37,457","00:08:39,407","It gives some men courage.
"
5,2,63,"00:08:39,805","00:08:41,377","Does it give you courage?
"
5,2,64,"00:08:44,146","00:08:45,381","That's far enough.
"
5,2,65,"00:08:47,315","00:08:48,712","Lord Baelish.
"
5,2,66,"00:08:49,211","00:08:50,471","Lady Sansa.
"
5,2,67,"00:08:50,850","00:08:52,708","My name is Brienne of Tarth.
"
5,2,68,"00:08:52,828","00:08:55,228","We've met, with Renly Baratheon.
"
5,2,69,"00:08:56,126","00:08:57,536","What did he say about you?
"
5,2,70,"00:08:58,184","00:08:59,257","He said,
"
5,2,71,"00:09:00,455","00:09:03,187","Your loyalty came free of charge.
"
5,2,72,"00:09:04,397","00:09:07,291","Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.
"
5,2,73,"00:09:20,842","00:09:22,277","Lady Sansa.
"
5,2,74,"00:09:23,699","00:09:25,109","Before your mother's death,
"
5,2,75,"00:09:25,470","00:09:27,304","I was her sworn sword.
"
5,2,76,"00:09:28,040","00:09:30,934","I gave my word I will
find you and protect you.
"
5,2,77,"00:09:31,258","00:09:32,618","I will shield your back
"
5,2,78,"00:09:32,738","00:09:33,934","and keep your counsel,
"
5,2,79,"00:09:34,233","00:09:36,641","and give my life for you if needs be.
"
5,2,80,"00:09:37,146","00:09:39,890","I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.
"
5,2,81,"00:09:41,269","00:09:43,128","Please, lady Brienne.
"
5,2,82,"00:09:43,390","00:09:45,161","No need for such formality.
"
5,2,83,"00:09:45,735","00:09:47,806","You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.
"
5,2,84,"00:09:47,926","00:09:49,739","- I was.
- Strange.
"
5,2,85,"00:09:50,101","00:09:52,840","I knew Cat since the time we were children.
She never mentioned you.
"
5,2,86,"00:09:53,591","00:09:55,337","It was after Renly's murder.
"
5,2,87,"00:09:55,457","00:09:56,659","Ah, yes.
"
5,2,88,"00:09:56,931","00:09:58,553","You were accused of killing him.
"
5,2,89,"00:09:58,673","00:09:59,975","I tried to save him.
"
5,2,90,"00:10:00,095","00:10:03,066","- But you were accused.
- By men who did not see what happened.
"
5,2,91,"00:10:03,186","00:10:04,438","And what did happen?
"
5,2,92,"00:10:09,497","00:10:11,325","He was murdered by a shadow.
"
5,2,93,"00:10:11,896","00:10:14,484","A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.
"
5,2,94,"00:10:14,604","00:10:16,807","A shadow?
"
5,2,95,"00:10:18,253","00:10:19,776","With a face?
"
5,2,96,"00:10:22,357","00:10:24,540","This woman swore to protect Renly,
"
5,2,97,"00:10:24,660","00:10:25,855","she failed.
"
5,2,98,"00:10:25,975","00:10:27,502","She swore to protect your mother,
"
5,2,99,"00:10:28,363","00:10:29,423","she failed.
"
5,2,100,"00:10:29,878","00:10:33,508","Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?
"
5,2,101,"00:10:33,628","00:10:35,506","Why should you have any
say in her affairs?
"
5,2,102,"00:10:35,626","00:10:36,990","Because I am her uncle.
"
5,2,103,"00:10:37,110","00:10:40,595","I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.
"
5,2,104,"00:10:40,848","00:10:43,679","We're family now. And you are an outsider.
"
5,2,105,"00:10:43,799","00:10:44,870","Forgive me, Lady Brienne.
"
5,2,106,"00:10:44,990","00:10:47,917","But experience has made
me wary of outsiders.
"
5,2,107,"00:10:48,037","00:10:49,402","Lady Sansa...
"
5,2,108,"00:10:49,522","00:10:51,672","- if we can have a word alone...
- No.
"
5,2,109,"00:10:52,269","00:10:55,350","- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...
- I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...
"
5,2,110,"00:10:55,470","00:10:56,653","bowing to the king.
"
5,2,111,"00:10:56,878","00:10:58,611","Neither of us wanted to be there.
"
5,2,112,"00:11:00,276","00:11:03,245","- Sometimes we don't have a choice.
- And sometimes we do.
"
5,2,113,"00:11:05,290","00:11:06,488","You should leave.
"
5,2,114,"00:11:07,985","00:11:10,829","We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.
"
5,2,115,"00:11:10,949","00:11:12,600","The roads in these parts aren't safe.
"
5,2,116,"00:11:13,124","00:11:14,459","Why don't you stay?
"
5,2,117,"00:11:23,599","00:11:25,620","I'm gonna ask you to stay.
"
5,2,118,"00:12:13,314","00:12:15,135","Stop! Stop! After him!
"
5,2,119,"00:12:16,756","00:12:17,779","Podrick!
"
5,2,120,"00:12:55,646","00:12:57,217","Stop, stop, stop, stop!
"
5,2,121,"00:12:57,654","00:12:59,014","Stop!
"
5,2,122,"00:13:02,095","00:13:03,614","That's a good boy. Come on.
"
5,2,123,"00:13:03,888","00:13:04,811","Come on!
"
5,2,124,"00:13:07,169","00:13:08,653","No, no, no, stop!
"
5,2,125,"00:13:28,989","00:13:30,486","Guess that means you're unarmed.
"
5,2,126,"00:13:31,908","00:13:33,305","Don't! Put that down!
"
5,2,127,"00:13:53,229","00:13:53,978","Podrick?
"
5,2,128,"00:13:55,038","00:13:56,011","Yes, my Lady?
"
5,2,129,"00:13:56,760","00:13:57,982","You can stand now.
"
5,2,130,"00:13:58,682","00:13:59,581","Yes, my Lady.
"
5,2,131,"00:14:04,096","00:14:05,181","Sansa Stark?
"
5,2,132,"00:14:06,441","00:14:08,437","Wary of strangers, as she should be.
"
5,2,133,"00:14:08,849","00:14:11,319","I saw her riding on the
Eastroad with Littlefinger.
"
5,2,134,"00:14:11,680","00:14:13,477","- We'll follow them.
- My Lady...
"
5,2,135,"00:14:14,188","00:14:16,408","if both Stark girls refused your service,
"
5,2,136,"00:14:17,181","00:14:18,691","maybe you're released from your vow.
"
5,2,137,"00:14:19,090","00:14:21,152","I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.
"
5,2,138,"00:14:21,272","00:14:22,552","They don't want your protection.
"
5,2,139,"00:14:22,582","00:14:24,143","You think she's safe with Littlefinger?
"
5,2,140,"00:14:26,990","00:14:28,038","No, my Lady.
"
5,2,141,"00:14:28,337","00:14:29,772","Get your horse.
"
5,2,142,"00:14:39,586","00:14:41,145","A summons from the Queen.
"
5,2,143,"00:14:59,860","00:15:01,818","There are only two like it in the world.
"
5,2,144,"00:15:03,066","00:15:05,423","The one I'm wearing and the
one I gave to Myrcella.
"
5,2,145,"00:15:05,913","00:15:06,874","It's a threat.
"
5,2,146,"00:15:06,994","00:15:08,583","Of course it's a threat.
"
5,2,147,"00:15:09,294","00:15:13,621","Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded
by people who hate our family.
"
5,2,148,"00:15:14,648","00:15:16,856","It's a threat,
"
5,2,149,"00:15:18,534","00:15:19,270","No note?
"
5,2,150,"00:15:19,390","00:15:22,217","They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister.
"
5,2,151,"00:15:22,534","00:15:24,117","And every other tragedy that
"
5,2,152,"00:15:24,237","00:15:25,820","has befallen their accursed country.
"
5,2,153,"00:15:25,940","00:15:28,365","I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.
"
5,2,154,"00:15:28,485","00:15:29,313","Softer.
"
5,2,155,"00:15:29,433","00:15:30,146","What?
"
5,2,156,"00:15:30,266","00:15:31,194","Not so loud.
"
5,2,157,"00:15:31,314","00:15:34,413","Our daughter is in danger and you're worried
I am speaking too loudly?
"
5,2,158,"00:15:34,533","00:15:36,406","No one can know she's our daughter.
"
5,2,159,"00:15:37,937","00:15:40,042","Then don't call her your daughter.
"
5,2,160,"00:15:40,331","00:15:42,028","You've never been a father to her.
"
5,2,161,"00:15:42,148","00:15:44,647","If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the streets.
"
5,2,162,"00:15:44,767","00:15:46,169","And what has your caution brought?
"
5,2,163,"00:15:48,095","00:15:50,478","Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding,
"
5,2,164,"00:15:51,026","00:15:53,372","our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,
"
5,2,165,"00:15:54,724","00:15:58,878","our baby boy set to marry that
smirking whore from Highgarden!
"
5,2,166,"00:16:08,039","00:16:09,286","I'm gonna make things better.
"
5,2,167,"00:16:09,406","00:16:10,767","You've never made anything better.
"
5,2,168,"00:16:10,864","00:16:12,033","I'm going to Dorne.
"
5,2,169,"00:16:12,533","00:16:14,130","And I'm bringing our daughter home.
"
5,2,170,"00:16:15,065","00:16:18,695","You can't just ask Prince
Doran to give her back.
"
5,2,171,"00:16:19,163","00:16:20,971","She's promised to his son.
"
5,2,172,"00:16:21,208","00:16:22,880","I'm not going to ask him anything.
"
5,2,173,"00:16:23,703","00:16:25,830","You go down there with an army
it's an act of war.
"
5,2,174,"00:16:25,950","00:16:26,803","No army.
"
5,2,175,"00:16:27,564","00:16:29,160","Do you know where they're keeping her?
"
5,2,176,"00:16:32,690","00:16:34,686","Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
"
5,2,177,"00:16:35,110","00:16:36,046","I'll find her.
"
5,2,178,"00:16:39,345","00:16:40,879","Is there anything else, Your Grace?
"
5,2,179,"00:16:44,553","00:16:45,800","You're going to Dorne.
"
5,2,180,"00:16:47,022","00:16:48,806","A one-handed man.
"
5,2,181,"00:16:49,579","00:16:50,814","Alone.
"
5,2,182,"00:16:51,805","00:16:53,676","Who said I was going alone?
"
5,2,183,"00:17:01,985","00:17:04,343","No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.
"
5,2,184,"00:17:04,567","00:17:06,775","Roses are very nice,
definitely roses.
"
5,2,185,"00:17:06,895","00:17:08,607","And music. I adore music.
"
5,2,186,"00:17:08,727","00:17:09,929","But no flutes.
"
5,2,187,"00:17:10,049","00:17:12,860","I hate flutes. We can have a harp,
if you like, but no flutes.
"
5,2,188,"00:17:12,980","00:17:13,860","Then there's the food.
"
5,2,189,"00:17:13,888","00:17:16,113","The food is the most important thing,
don't you agree?
"
5,2,190,"00:17:16,233","00:17:17,822","We're gonna need pigeon pies.
"
5,2,191,"00:17:18,062","00:17:20,420","That's what they eat in the capital,
don't they?
"
5,2,192,"00:17:21,218","00:17:22,827","Don't they?
"
5,2,193,"00:17:24,592","00:17:25,490","Don't who?
"
5,2,194,"00:17:25,714","00:17:28,989","People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
"
5,2,195,"00:17:29,675","00:17:31,434","They certainly do, my dear.
"
5,2,196,"00:17:31,664","00:17:33,036","They certainly do.
"
5,2,197,"00:17:34,022","00:17:35,831","It's a fine place, isn't it?
"
5,2,198,"00:17:36,585","00:17:38,157","A fine place.
"
5,2,199,"00:17:38,718","00:17:42,342","I never thought I'd end up settling down
in a place like this.
"
5,2,200,"00:17:42,965","00:17:43,951","You won't.
"
5,2,201,"00:17:45,604","00:17:46,277","Pardon?
"
5,2,202,"00:17:46,514","00:17:48,398","We won't get to live at Stokeworth.
"
5,2,203,"00:17:48,518","00:17:51,460","When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.
"
5,2,204,"00:17:51,784","00:17:53,456","She hates me.
"
5,2,205,"00:17:53,576","00:17:55,056","She calls me mean names and sometimes
"
5,2,206,"00:17:55,160","00:17:57,909","even still she pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.
"
5,2,207,"00:18:00,114","00:18:01,386","You know what I think?
"
5,2,208,"00:18:02,160","00:18:03,831","I think you're a good person.
"
5,2,209,"00:18:04,455","00:18:06,625","And your sister is a mean person.
"
5,2,210,"00:18:06,745","00:18:07,636","She is.
"
5,2,211,"00:18:10,255","00:18:11,540","I've been all over the world
"
5,2,212,"00:18:11,920","00:18:13,554","and if there's one thing I've learned,
"
5,2,213,"00:18:14,140","00:18:16,086","is that meanness comes around.
"
5,2,214,"00:18:17,121","00:18:18,568","People like your sister,
"
5,2,215,"00:18:19,279","00:18:21,767","they always get what's coming for them,
eventually.
"
5,2,216,"00:18:22,566","00:18:24,250","One way or another.
"
5,2,217,"00:18:27,774","00:18:28,884","Who's that?
"
5,2,218,"00:18:32,258","00:18:33,892","Jaime fucking Lannister.
"
5,2,219,"00:18:36,318","00:18:37,142","Ser Jaime?
"
5,2,220,"00:18:37,262","00:18:38,539","Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
"
5,2,221,"00:18:40,345","00:18:42,453","I was very sorry to hear about your father.
"
5,2,222,"00:18:42,908","00:18:43,657","Thank you.
"
5,2,223,"00:18:44,580","00:18:46,937","This is my betrothed, Lollys.
"
5,2,224,"00:18:48,777","00:18:49,999","A pleasure.
"
5,2,225,"00:18:53,030","00:18:54,091","Run along, love.
"
5,2,226,"00:19:00,979","00:19:03,038","Beautiful young bride you've chosen.
"
5,2,227,"00:19:03,749","00:19:05,389","When are you planning on getting married?
"
5,2,228,"00:19:05,520","00:19:06,481","Just get on with it.
"
5,2,229,"00:19:06,767","00:19:07,666","On with what?
"
5,2,230,"00:19:07,786","00:19:08,925","What you're here for.
"
5,2,231,"00:19:09,358","00:19:12,526","There's no way this little visit
could possibly mean anything good for me.
"
5,2,232,"00:19:12,646","00:19:13,774","It's very good for you.
"
5,2,233,"00:19:26,445","00:19:28,939","Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.
"
5,2,234,"00:19:29,164","00:19:30,276","Mmm.
"
5,2,235,"00:19:30,641","00:19:32,882","We've made a deal, your sister and I.
"
5,2,236,"00:19:33,224","00:19:34,905","I would have advised against that.
"
5,2,237,"00:19:35,025","00:19:36,123","How is this good for me?
"
5,2,238,"00:19:36,243","00:19:39,163","Because you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.
"
5,2,239,"00:19:39,193","00:19:40,703","And when we return...
"
5,2,240,"00:19:40,823","00:19:44,553","I'm gonna give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.
"
5,2,241,"00:19:47,135","00:19:49,060","Return from where?
"
5,2,242,"00:19:49,518","00:19:51,981","As far south as south goes.
"
5,2,243,"00:20:16,265","00:20:18,255","<i>You are my queen.</i>
"
5,2,244,"00:20:27,097","00:20:29,253","The prince does not
wish to be disturbed.
"
5,2,245,"00:20:29,450","00:20:30,888","Remove yourself from my path
"
5,2,246,"00:20:30,923","00:20:32,958","or I'll take that long axe
and I'll shove it up your...
"
5,2,247,"00:20:32,993","00:20:34,082","<i>Captain...</i>
"
5,2,248,"00:20:35,992","00:20:37,328","let her pass.
"
5,2,249,"00:20:41,775","00:20:43,354","Your brother was murdered...
"
5,2,250,"00:20:44,077","00:20:46,235","and you sit here
in the Water Gardens
"
5,2,251,"00:20:46,270","00:20:48,570","staring at the sky
and doing nothing.
"
5,2,252,"00:20:48,605","00:20:51,140","Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat
"
5,2,253,"00:20:51,142","00:20:52,853","by law, that is no murder.
"
5,2,254,"00:20:52,855","00:20:55,479","- Your brother...
- You don't have to remind me.
"
5,2,255,"00:20:55,514","00:20:58,720","He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.
"
5,2,256,"00:20:59,103","00:21:00,302","What will you know about his death?
"
5,2,257,"00:21:00,304","00:21:03,025","I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.
"
5,2,258,"00:21:03,060","00:21:04,075","And then?
"
5,2,259,"00:21:04,110","00:21:05,388","You would have me go to war.
"
5,2,260,"00:21:05,390","00:21:07,133","The whole country
would have you go to war.
"
5,2,261,"00:21:07,168","00:21:10,309","Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.
"
5,2,262,"00:21:12,443","00:21:14,310","The Sand Snakes are with me.
"
5,2,263,"00:21:14,345","00:21:15,929","They have the love of their people.
"
5,2,264,"00:21:15,964","00:21:17,182","They will avenge their father
"
5,2,265,"00:21:17,184","00:21:21,153","while you sit here
in your chair doing nothing.
"
5,2,266,"00:21:25,643","00:21:27,182","Oberyn is dead.
"
5,2,267,"00:21:28,041","00:21:30,968","And this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens
"
5,2,268,"00:21:30,970","00:21:34,293","eating our food,
breathing our air.
"
5,2,269,"00:21:35,382","00:21:36,854","How many of your
brothers and sisters
"
5,2,270,"00:21:36,856","00:21:38,540","do they have to kill?
"
5,2,271,"00:21:39,637","00:21:41,033","<i>Let me have her.</i>
"
5,2,272,"00:21:42,960","00:21:47,063","Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.
"
5,2,273,"00:21:48,360","00:21:50,451","I loved my brother.
"
5,2,274,"00:21:50,486","00:21:52,721","And you made him very happy.
"
5,2,275,"00:21:52,756","00:21:55,638","For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.
"
5,2,276,"00:21:56,937","00:22:01,335","But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.
"
5,2,277,"00:22:01,370","00:22:02,954","Not here.
"
5,2,278,"00:22:02,989","00:22:04,989","Not while I rule.
"
5,2,279,"00:22:06,083","00:22:07,782","And how long would that be?
"
5,2,280,"00:22:24,102","00:22:26,301","The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
"
5,2,281,"00:22:26,697","00:22:29,031","Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.
"
5,2,282,"00:22:29,602","00:22:31,674","'Course you haven't found any
Sons of the Harpy.
"
5,2,283,"00:22:32,204","00:22:33,599","You haven't, have you?
"
5,2,284,"00:22:35,761","00:22:38,202","My Second Sons
on the other hand...
"
5,2,285,"00:22:38,647","00:22:43,133","they drink, they whore,
fight in streets,
"
5,2,286,"00:22:43,635","00:22:44,879","they blend in.
"
5,2,287,"00:22:44,914","00:22:47,214","They overhear things in taverns.
"
5,2,288,"00:22:47,349","00:22:50,797","Follow people from the taverns
to nice quiet alleys.
"
5,2,289,"00:22:51,229","00:22:55,303","Break a few fingers,
overhear a few more things...
"
5,2,290,"00:22:56,624","00:22:58,026","before you know it...
"
5,2,291,"00:23:17,836","00:23:19,273","No one here.
"
5,2,292,"00:23:20,203","00:23:21,371","We go.
"
5,2,293,"00:23:21,606","00:23:23,174","In a hurry?
"
5,2,294,"00:23:23,209","00:23:24,151","You're afraid?
"
5,2,295,"00:23:24,186","00:23:26,634","Unsullied fear nothing.
"
5,2,296,"00:23:27,254","00:23:28,820","Right.
"
5,2,297,"00:23:28,921","00:23:30,332","That's your problem.
"
5,2,298,"00:23:30,467","00:23:34,630","You understood fear once, long ago,
but you forgot what it means.
"
5,2,299,"00:23:35,472","00:23:37,486","Someone who's forgotten fear...
"
5,2,300,"00:23:38,003","00:23:39,975","has forgotten how to hide.
"
5,2,301,"00:23:48,770","00:23:50,725","Fear is useful that way.
"
5,2,302,"00:24:15,357","00:24:16,680","Sons of the Harpy...
"
5,2,303,"00:24:16,715","00:24:19,002","they want to put a collar
back on my neck.
"
5,2,304,"00:24:19,237","00:24:21,437","On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace...
"
5,2,305,"00:24:21,472","00:24:23,872","- <i>you must kill him.</i>
- It would send a message.
"
5,2,306,"00:24:23,907","00:24:26,007","I think you should
exercise restraint...
"
5,2,307,"00:24:26,042","00:24:27,185","- <i>Your Grace.</i>
- Why?
"
5,2,308,"00:24:27,187","00:24:29,307","Well, for one thing, he
may have valuable information.
"
5,2,309,"00:24:29,329","00:24:32,497","Well, the Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.
"
5,2,310,"00:24:32,532","00:24:33,673","How do you know that?
"
5,2,311,"00:24:33,708","00:24:35,411","Because I questioned him.
"
5,2,312,"00:24:35,922","00:24:38,406","And the information you did get...
he is young and..
"
5,2,313,"00:24:38,441","00:24:39,545","He is born free.
"
5,2,314,"00:24:39,580","00:24:40,759","Why should he want
to bring back slavery?
"
5,2,315,"00:24:40,794","00:24:41,830","What did it do for him?
"
5,2,316,"00:24:41,865","00:24:43,330","Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride
"
5,2,317,"00:24:43,450","00:24:45,186","was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.
"
5,2,318,"00:24:45,221","00:24:46,554","<i>They pay him.</i>
"
5,2,319,"00:24:46,589","00:24:48,789","Great families, afraid to do a thing.
"
5,2,320,"00:24:48,824","00:24:50,079","They pay poor men
to do it for them.
"
5,2,321,"00:24:50,114","00:24:51,192","And how do you know this?
"
5,2,322,"00:24:51,227","00:24:52,927","- <i>Everyone know this.</i>
- I don't know it.
"
5,2,323,"00:24:52,962","00:24:54,129","<i>And I'm the head of a great family.</i>
"
5,2,324,"00:24:54,164","00:24:56,698","<i>We do not know what
this man did or didn't do.</i>
"
5,2,325,"00:24:56,733","00:24:58,933","Give him a trial at least.
"
5,2,326,"00:24:58,968","00:25:00,454","A fair trial.
"
5,2,327,"00:25:01,103","00:25:02,440","Show all the citizens of Meereen
"
5,2,328,"00:25:02,475","00:25:04,999","that you are better than those
who would depose you.
"
5,2,329,"00:25:05,234","00:25:06,426","Teach them a better way.
"
5,2,330,"00:25:06,461","00:25:09,022","I do not know the place

5,2,344,"00:25:50,214","00:25:51,842","About your father.
"
5,2,345,"00:25:51,877","00:25:53,877","- About the Mad King.

"
5,2,358,"00:26:25,520","00:26:27,851","and his efforts to stamp out dissent
"
5,2,359,"00:26:29,069","00:26:31,621","led to a rebellion

"
5,2,387,"00:28:07,153","00:28:09,153","I told you.
A ruler.

"
5,2,497,"00:33:33,799","00:33:34,423","I taught Ser Davos.

5,2,500,"00:33:40,411","00:33:41,622","Very patient.
"
5,2,501,"00:33:41,657","00:33:44,564","I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing
"
5,2,502,"00:33:44,599","00:33:45,664","<i>the faster you will
be able to read.</i>
"
5,2,503,"00:33:45,699","00:33:47,112","That's all right.

5,2,504,"00:33:47,435","00:33:48,766","We're doing just fine.

5,2,505,"00:33:48,801","00:33:53,148","I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

5,2,508,"00:34:00,194","00:34:01,693","Were you taught by your mother?

5,2,510,"00:34:03,518","00:34:05,418","Our Maester Cressen did.

5,2,511,"00:34:05,453","00:34:08,887","I had a lot of time to practice.
My mother kept me inside because...

5,2,512,"00:34:11,635","00:34:15,740","What do you call it in the south?
What happened to your face.
"
5,2,513,"00:34:15,775","00:34:17,734","Grayscale.

"
5,2,516,"00:34:22,473","00:34:25,799","But two of my sisters had it.
They both died.

5,2,517,"00:34:26,060","00:34:27,535","How did they cure you?

5,2,518,"00:34:27,570","00:34:30,155","I don't remember.
I was a baby.
"
5,2,519,"00:34:30,375","00:34:32,592","A lot of people came and tried, I think.

5,2,520,"00:34:32,627","00:34:34,930","Whatever they did, it went away.

5,2,522,"00:34:40,655","00:34:44,769","My father made them move out
to the keep, outside.

5,2,523,"00:34:45,458","00:34:47,392","None of us were allowed
to go near them.

5,2,524,"00:34:47,762","00:34:51,784","But we heard them,
especially at night.
"
5,2,525,"00:34:52,326","00:34:56,680","They started to sound
not like themselves.
"
5,2,526,"00:34:57,315","00:34:58,684","Did you ever see them?

5,2,527,"00:34:59,827","00:35:01,459","Only once, at the end.
"
5,2,528,"00:35:03,409","00:35:04,795","They were covered with it.
"
5,2,529,"00:35:06,034","00:35:11,281","Their faces, their arms,
they acted like animals.
"
5,2,530,"00:35:12,582","00:35:15,500","My father had to drag them out
to the woods on a rope.
"
5,2,531,"00:35:16,400","00:35:18,202","What did he do with
them in the woods?

"
5,2,535,"00:35:33,010","00:35:34,580","You need to stay
away from that girl.
"
5,2,536,"00:35:34,615","00:35:36,133","- Why?
- She's a wildling.
"
5,2,537,"00:35:36,168","00:35:37,414","Her name's Gilly.
"
5,2,538,"00:35:37,449","00:35:39,249","She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.
"
5,2,539,"00:35:39,284","00:35:42,537","She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.
"
5,2,540,"00:35:42,572","00:35:45,189","He executed their king
for treason.
"
5,2,541,"00:35:45,481","00:35:48,460","They could strike at him
by striking at you.
"
5,2,542,"00:35:48,495","00:35:50,166","Gilly wouldn't do that.
"
5,2,543,"00:35:51,730","00:35:53,888","You have no idea
what people will do.
"
5,2,544,"00:35:55,007","00:35:57,219","All your books
and you still don't know.
"
5,2,545,"00:36:03,318","00:36:06,012","I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.
"
5,2,546,"00:36:06,047","00:36:08,347","You prevented that order
from being carried out.
"
5,2,547,"00:36:08,382","00:36:10,882","You showed mercy
to Mance Rayder.

"
5,2,549,"00:36:13,514","00:36:17,355","Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.
"
5,2,550,"00:36:21,090","00:36:23,083","Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.
"
5,2,551,"00:36:23,118","00:36:25,218","If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.
"
5,2,552,"00:36:26,041","00:36:28,441","With respect, Your Grace,
the free folk will never follow you

"
5,2,554,"00:36:30,978","00:36:32,956","You're the man
who burned their king alive.
"
5,2,555,"00:36:33,545","00:36:34,791","Who then?
"
5,2,556,"00:36:36,865","00:36:38,235","You?
"
5,2,557,"00:36:38,270","00:36:41,460","No.
Only one of their own.

"
5,2,559,"00:36:46,755","00:36:49,296","- Lyanna Mormont.
- Lord Commander's niece.
"
5,2,560,"00:36:49,690","00:36:51,155","Lady of Bear Island.
"
5,2,561,"00:36:51,525","00:36:53,112","And a child of ten.
"
5,2,562,"00:36:54,685","00:36:57,561","I asked her to commit her house
to my court. That's her response.

"
5,2,564,"00:37:01,025","00:37:03,010","whose name is Stark.

5,2,565,"00:37:03,359","00:37:05,208","That amuses you.
"
5,2,566,"00:37:06,790","00:37:08,550","I apologize, Your Grace.

5,2,567,"00:37:09,646","00:37:13,189","Northerners commit
a bit like the free folk.
"
5,2,568,"00:37:14,131","00:37:15,626","Loyal to their own.
"
5,2,569,"00:37:16,043","00:37:17,157","I know.
"
5,2,570,"00:37:17,192","00:37:20,359","My brother, Robert, went on often
and loudly about how difficult it was

5,2,571,"00:37:20,394","00:37:21,890","to control them.
"
5,2,572,"00:37:23,913","00:37:25,910","Even with your father's help.

elect a new Lord Commander.

is going to win.
"
5,2,575,"00:37:34,536","00:37:36,555","- Most likely.
- One pleasant man.
"
5,2,576,"00:37:36,991","00:37:38,549","He thinks you're a traitor.
"
5,2,577,"00:37:39,736","00:37:41,251","What's your life gonna
be like here at the Wall,
"
5,2,578,"00:37:41,286","00:37:44,096","- with Thorne in command?
- Unpleasant, I expect.
"
5,2,579,"00:37:44,131","00:37:45,933","Your bravery made him look weak.
"
5,2,580,"00:37:47,410","00:37:48,853","He'll punish you for it.
"
5,2,581,"00:37:49,141","00:37:51,063","I don't punish men for bravery.
"
5,2,582,"00:37:51,098","00:37:52,592","I reward them.

5,2,584,"00:37:55,975","00:37:57,728","But I am a brother
of the Night's Watch.

my honor, my sword.

I have left to give you.

5,2,589,"00:38:08,808","00:38:11,027","Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard.

5,2,591,"00:38:13,025","00:38:15,640","Kneel before me.
Lay your sword at my feet.

"
5,2,594,"00:38:25,867","00:38:28,276","He'll make you a Stark
with a stroke of a pen.

5,2,595,"00:38:28,740","00:38:30,929","It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

5,2,596,"00:38:32,361","00:38:35,168","I daydreamed that my father
would ask the king.

5,2,597,"00:38:35,203","00:38:37,601","Just like that I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

You do.

5,2,600,"00:38:43,851","00:38:45,393","I'm gonna refuse him.

5,2,601,"00:38:47,426","00:38:48,665","But...
"
5,2,602,"00:38:48,700","00:38:50,695","you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

5,2,603,"00:38:51,315","00:38:53,496","I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

5,2,656,"00:41:40,022","00:41:41,872","And now we've all seen it too.
"
5,2,657,"00:41:42,569","00:41:43,866","He may be young,
"
5,2,658,"00:41:45,138","00:41:47,177","but he's the commander we turned to
"
5,2,659,"00:41:47,297","00:41:48,973","when the night was darkest.
"
5,2,660,"00:41:49,093","00:41:50,505","Yeah!
"
5,2,661,"00:41:56,655","00:41:57,815","Aye.
"
5,2,662,"00:41:58,090","00:42:00,073","Can't argue with any of that.
"
5,2,663,"00:42:01,320","00:42:03,591","But who does Jon Snow want to command?
"
5,2,664,"00:42:04,052","00:42:05,361","The Night's Watch?
"
5,2,665,"00:42:07,070","00:42:08,455","Or the wildlings?
"
5,2,666,"00:42:09,284","00:42:12,627","Everyone knows he loved
a wildling girl.
"
5,2,667,"00:42:12,747","00:42:14,560","He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.
"
5,2,668,"00:42:14,680","00:42:18,050","What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends
"
5,2,669,"00:42:18,599","00:42:20,532","if Stannis's army hadn't come along?
"
5,2,670,"00:42:20,814","00:42:25,352","We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.
"
5,2,671,"00:42:25,617","00:42:28,767","Do you want to choose a man who has fought
the wildlings all his life
"
5,2,672,"00:42:29,674","00:42:31,845","or a man who makes love to them?
"
5,2,673,"00:42:39,669","00:42:41,116","It is time!
"
5,2,674,"00:43:27,912","00:43:30,526","Appears to be a tie, maester.
"
5,2,675,"00:43:50,988","00:43:52,832","Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
"
5,2,676,"00:43:53,486","00:43:55,271","Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
"
5,2,677,"00:43:55,391","00:43:57,412","Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
"
5,2,678,"00:44:25,148","00:44:27,584","You! You!
"
5,2,679,"00:44:31,271","00:44:32,465","What have you got there?
"
5,2,680,"00:44:35,632","00:44:38,215","- I said...
- Turn around and go!
"
5,2,681,"00:44:40,505","00:44:42,089","Turn around...
"
5,2,682,"00:44:42,552","00:44:44,866","- and go!
- That's a nice little sword.
"
5,2,683,"00:44:45,207","00:44:47,400","Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.
"
5,2,684,"00:44:49,836","00:44:52,005","Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
"
5,2,685,"00:44:56,025","00:44:57,365","Quickly, go! Go!
"
5,2,686,"00:45:11,030","00:45:12,296","Who are you?
"
5,2,687,"00:45:13,222","00:45:14,879","Why were they scared of you?
"
5,2,688,"00:45:14,999","00:45:16,438","You lost this.
"
5,2,689,"00:45:27,939","00:45:29,913","You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
"
5,2,690,"00:45:30,254","00:45:31,472","There isn't.
"
5,2,691,"00:45:31,592","00:45:33,689","A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
"
5,2,692,"00:45:36,369","00:45:38,099","Who are you then?
"
5,2,693,"00:45:39,025","00:45:40,560","No one.
"
5,2,694,"00:45:40,950","00:45:42,826","And that is who a girl must become.

"

"
5,3,18,"00:04:23,829","00:04:25,524","And no man know his gift.

- Yes.
"
5,3,27,"00:06:43,888","00:06:46,247","I was scared maybe I hurt you,

"
5,3,29,"00:06:48,521","00:06:49,709","you're very sweet.

5,3,33,"00:07:02,365","00:07:04,123","Shouldn't we rest a little while?

5,3,34,"00:07:04,124","00:07:06,678","Just to catch our breath,
there's no rush, is there?
"
5,3,35,"00:07:07,077","00:07:08,163","Of course not.
"
5,3,36,"00:07:09,569","00:07:10,538","Are you hungry?

5,3,37,"00:07:10,726","00:07:13,155","Shall I have them bring you some cake

5,3,40,"00:07:18,281","00:07:23,484","I want to know everything there is to know
about King Tommen First of His Name.
"
5,3,41,"00:07:24,117","00:07:27,773","King Tommen...
it still sounds strange to me.

"
5,3,43,"00:07:32,601","00:07:36,671","- So strange. Husband.
- Wife.
"
5,3,44,"00:07:39,906","00:07:41,476","Sometimes it feels odd.
"
5,3,45,"00:07:42,234","00:07:47,250","I'm the king, I've married
the most beautiful woman in the world,
"
5,3,46,"00:07:48,250","00:07:50,141","and it's all because my brother died.
"
5,3,47,"00:07:51,320","00:07:52,484","I understand.
"
5,3,48,"00:07:53,390","00:07:56,117","But it's no your fault,
you know that, don't you?
"
5,3,49,"00:07:56,726","00:07:58,390","You mustn't feel guilty.
"
5,3,50,"00:07:59,796","00:08:03,359","I don't feel guilty.
That's what's odd.
"
5,3,51,"00:08:07,209","00:08:08,671","Do you like to sail?
"
5,3,52,"00:08:09,248","00:08:11,889","- I love to sail.
- I do, too.
"
5,3,53,"00:08:13,092","00:08:15,740","I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.
"
5,3,54,"00:08:16,522","00:08:17,561","I do, too.
"
5,3,55,"00:08:20,522","00:08:25,030","Living in a tower so high,
it touches the clouds.
"
5,3,56,"00:08:26,850","00:08:29,483","Of course my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.
"
5,3,57,"00:08:29,787","00:08:32,310","The capital is not for everyone, I suppose.
"
5,3,58,"00:08:34,576","00:08:36,225","Does your mother like it here?
"
5,3,59,"00:08:37,694","00:08:38,952","I don't think so.
"
5,3,60,"00:08:39,459","00:08:41,779","She told me never to trust anyone
in King's Landing.
"
5,3,61,"00:08:43,897","00:08:46,452","It's so wonderful to have her
watching over you.
"
5,3,62,"00:08:46,944","00:08:49,319","A lioness guiding her cub.
"
5,3,63,"00:08:49,655","00:08:52,632","Well, but I'm a man now.
"
5,3,64,"00:08:54,858","00:08:56,046","You are.
"
5,3,65,"00:08:58,100","00:08:59,155","And the king.
"
5,3,66,"00:09:02,133","00:09:04,422","But you'll always be her baby-boy.
"
5,3,67,"00:09:04,915","00:09:05,978","I suppose.
"
5,3,68,"00:09:07,368","00:09:11,126","I adore how she has always been
so generous with me, so kind.
"
5,3,69,"00:09:12,329","00:09:14,626","And the horror she's had to endure.
"
5,3,70,"00:09:14,923","00:09:18,189","Losing her husband,
her eldest child and her father.
"
5,3,71,"00:09:18,190","00:09:20,399","It's no wonder she's so protective of you.
"
5,3,72,"00:09:20,946","00:09:23,368","She'll never let you out of her sight.
"
5,3,73,"00:09:27,009","00:09:28,618","You're very much in love.
"
5,3,74,"00:09:29,118","00:09:32,001","The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.
"
5,3,75,"00:09:32,383","00:09:34,086","She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?
"
5,3,76,"00:09:35,422","00:09:38,547","Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot.
"
5,3,77,"00:09:40,024","00:09:44,406","Do you think she's intelligent?
I can't quite tell.
"
5,3,78,"00:09:45,711","00:09:48,539","- Not that it matters.
- Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
"
5,3,79,"00:09:48,540","00:09:50,540","There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
"
5,3,80,"00:09:51,742","00:09:53,203","That's where you grew up.
"
5,3,81,"00:09:55,125","00:09:57,477","You always told me
that you liked the people there better.
"
5,3,82,"00:09:58,109","00:10:01,632","You said that King's Landing
smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
"
5,3,83,"00:10:04,468","00:10:08,452","- Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
- The way that you talked about it...
"
5,3,84,"00:10:09,265","00:10:10,749","I always thought that you missed it.
"
5,3,85,"00:10:11,821","00:10:16,320","- That you... That it was your real home.
- This is my real home now.
"
5,3,86,"00:10:16,321","00:10:18,321","Where my family lives.
"
5,3,87,"00:10:19,001","00:10:21,064","I want you to be happy, mother.
"
5,3,88,"00:10:22,290","00:10:23,165","I know that.
"
5,3,89,"00:10:25,102","00:10:29,883","- I know you do, my sweet boy.
- But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
"
5,3,90,"00:10:32,680","00:10:38,157","I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough,
are you trying to set a new record?""
"
5,3,91,"00:10:38,158","00:10:42,087","And he said, ""Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it.""
"
5,3,92,"00:10:47,314","00:10:48,267","Mother.
"
5,3,93,"00:10:49,205","00:10:50,174","Welcome.
"
5,3,94,"00:10:51,764","00:10:52,914","Well don't you look lovely.
"
5,3,95,"00:10:53,401","00:10:54,401","Marriage agrees with you.
"
5,3,96,"00:10:54,521","00:10:57,123","Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?
"
5,3,97,"00:10:57,243","00:11:00,710","I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.
"
5,3,98,"00:11:02,726","00:11:05,257","No, no, I...I can't stay.
"
5,3,99,"00:11:06,119","00:11:07,969","I just wanted to let you know if...
"
5,3,100,"00:11:08,806","00:11:10,632","there is ever anything I can do for you.
"
5,3,101,"00:11:10,752","00:11:12,206","You are very sweet.
"
5,3,102,"00:11:12,691","00:11:14,917","Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.
"
5,3,103,"00:11:15,037","00:11:17,927","I absolutely adore him.
"
5,3,104,"00:11:18,047","00:11:19,902","You raised a gallant young man.
"
5,3,105,"00:11:20,152","00:11:21,927","- I'm forever grateful.
- Good.
"
5,3,106,"00:11:23,764","00:11:24,701","Good.
"
5,3,107,"00:11:25,227","00:11:26,427","I'm glad to hear you're happy.
"
5,3,108,"00:11:26,434","00:11:28,582","Ecstatic. I really am.
"
5,3,109,"00:11:29,015","00:11:31,615","Exhausted, to be honest, but
"
5,3,110,"00:11:31,735","00:11:34,641","what can I expect, he is
half lion, half stag.
"
5,3,111,"00:11:36,713","00:11:38,150","I'll leave you to it then.
"
5,3,112,"00:11:38,631","00:11:43,231","Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at
Court for long, I get so confused.
"
5,3,113,"00:11:43,351","00:11:45,519","What's the proper way to address you now?
"
5,3,114,"00:11:45,639","00:11:47,610","Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?
"
5,3,115,"00:11:49,915","00:11:51,690","There's no need for such formalities.
"
5,3,116,"00:11:51,810","00:11:54,994","In any event, judging from
the King's enthusiasm,
"
5,3,117,"00:11:55,114","00:11:57,656","the Queen Mother will be a
Queen Grandmother soon.
"
5,3,118,"00:11:57,776","00:11:59,035","That'll be a lovely day.
"
5,3,119,"00:11:59,260","00:12:00,797","Imagine the celebrations.
"
5,3,120,"00:12:00,917","00:12:03,132","They'll ring the bells all day and night.
"
5,3,121,"00:12:03,252","00:12:03,970","Remember.
"
5,3,122,"00:12:05,982","00:12:07,244","Anything you need.
"
5,3,123,"00:13:22,908","00:13:25,105","We can't hold the North with terror alone.
"
5,3,124,"00:13:25,225","00:13:28,035","You can't hold the North if you
let these lesser lords insult us.
"
5,3,125,"00:13:28,155","00:13:30,812","I sent you there to collect
taxes, not bodies.
"
5,3,126,"00:13:30,932","00:13:32,918","Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.
"
5,3,127,"00:13:33,813","00:13:36,125","He said the Warden of the
North will always be a Stark,
"
5,3,128,"00:13:36,245","00:13:38,607","and he'd be damned if he
kissed a traitor's boot.
"
5,3,129,"00:13:41,326","00:13:43,396","You left him no choice.
"
5,3,130,"00:13:43,689","00:13:44,958","I flayed him living,
"
5,3,131,"00:13:45,078","00:13:47,322","along with his wife and brother.
"
5,3,132,"00:13:47,662","00:13:49,212","I made his son watch.
"
5,3,133,"00:13:50,438","00:13:52,112","And?
"
5,3,134,"00:13:52,232","00:13:54,275","The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
"
5,3,135,"00:14:01,479","00:14:03,040","I have something important to tell you.
"
5,3,136,"00:14:04,679","00:14:06,566","Stop eating and listen.
"
5,3,137,"00:14:15,948","00:14:17,810","We don't have enough men to hold the North
"
5,3,138,"00:14:17,930","00:14:19,985","if the other Houses rise up against us.
"
5,3,139,"00:14:20,560","00:14:21,885","Do you understand that?
"
5,3,140,"00:14:22,005","00:14:23,347","Our pact with the Lannisters...
"
5,3,141,"00:14:23,467","00:14:25,697","I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.
"
5,3,142,"00:14:25,817","00:14:27,207","Tywin Lannister is dead.
"
5,3,143,"00:14:28,170","00:14:31,489","The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.
"
5,3,144,"00:14:31,739","00:14:34,099","They've never once in the
history of the Seven Kingdoms
"
5,3,145,"00:14:34,219","00:14:35,955","sent their army this far north.
"
5,3,146,"00:14:36,249","00:14:38,537","If you think they will for us,
you're a fool.
"
5,3,147,"00:14:40,006","00:14:43,568","We become a great House by entering
in alliances with other Houses,
"
5,3,148,"00:14:43,688","00:14:46,466","and parleying those alliances
into greater power.
"
5,3,149,"00:14:46,935","00:14:49,435","Now the best way to forge
a lasting alliance
"
5,3,150,"00:14:49,555","00:14:52,013","isn't by peeling a man's skin off,
"
5,3,151,"00:14:52,133","00:14:54,103","the best way is marriage.
"
5,3,152,"00:14:54,934","00:14:57,981","Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,
"
5,3,153,"00:14:58,332","00:15:00,969","it's time you married a suitable bride.
"
5,3,154,"00:15:04,505","00:15:05,946","And as it happens,
"
5,3,155,"00:15:06,361","00:15:09,730","I found the perfect girl to
solidify our hold in the North.
"
5,3,156,"00:15:31,764","00:15:34,153","- That's Moat Cailin.
- Yes.
"
5,3,157,"00:15:34,273","00:15:36,061","A bit shabby, isn't it?
"
5,3,158,"00:15:36,595","00:15:38,540","You've been here before.
"
5,3,159,"00:15:39,112","00:15:42,965","On our way down to King's Landing,
with my father and Arya and...
"
5,3,160,"00:15:43,538","00:15:46,627","- Where are you taking me?
- Home.
"
5,3,161,"00:15:48,531","00:15:50,851","The Boltons have Winterfell.
"
5,3,162,"00:15:53,994","00:15:56,893","The marriage proposal...It wasn't for you?
"
5,3,163,"00:15:57,992","00:15:59,457","No.
"
5,3,164,"00:15:59,884","00:16:04,157","Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family!
"
5,3,165,"00:16:04,277","00:16:06,047","He did.
"
5,3,166,"00:16:06,167","00:16:07,797","He serves the Lannisters.
"
5,3,167,"00:16:08,273","00:16:10,685","- For now.
- I won't go.
"
5,3,168,"00:16:10,805","00:16:12,754","- Winterfell is your home.
- Not anymore.
"
5,3,169,"00:16:12,874","00:16:15,479","Always. You're a Stark.
"
5,3,170,"00:16:16,126","00:16:18,838","Dyeing your hair doesn't change that.
You're Sansa Stark.
"
5,3,171,"00:16:19,244","00:16:21,807","The eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.
"
5,3,172,"00:16:22,480","00:16:23,925","Your place is in the North.
"
5,3,173,"00:16:24,045","00:16:25,888","I can't marry him.
You can't make me.
"
5,3,174,"00:16:26,008","00:16:28,158","He's a traitor.
A murderer.
"
5,3,175,"00:16:28,278","00:16:29,965","You're not marrying Roose Bolton.
"
5,3,176,"00:16:30,278","00:16:33,208","No, you'll be marrying his son and heir,
Ramsay.
"
5,3,177,"00:16:33,743","00:16:36,081","- One day he'll be Warden of the North and...
- No!
"
5,3,178,"00:16:36,337","00:16:38,337","- Sansa...
- No, you can't make me.
"
5,3,179,"00:16:38,457","00:16:41,715","I will starve myself. I will
die before I have to go there.
"
5,3,180,"00:16:41,835","00:16:44,178","I won't force you to do anything.
"
5,3,181,"00:16:45,206","00:16:47,118","Don't you know by now how
much I care for you?
"
5,3,182,"00:16:48,587","00:16:51,037","Say the word and we turn the
horses round, but listen to me.
"
5,3,183,"00:16:51,157","00:16:52,312","Listen.
"
5,3,184,"00:16:52,824","00:16:54,724","You've been running all your life.
"
5,3,185,"00:16:56,236","00:16:58,599","Terrible things happened to
your family and you weep.
"
5,3,186,"00:16:58,955","00:17:01,992","You sit alone in a dark room,
mourning their fates.
"
5,3,187,"00:17:02,112","00:17:06,016","You've been a bystander to tragedy from
the day they executed your father.
"
5,3,188,"00:17:06,773","00:17:10,606","Stop being a bystander, you hear me?
Stop running.
"
5,3,189,"00:17:15,726","00:17:17,589","There's no justice in the world.
"
5,3,190,"00:17:18,502","00:17:20,202","Not unless we make it.
"
5,3,191,"00:17:22,052","00:17:23,476","You loved your family.
"
5,3,192,"00:17:25,195","00:17:26,632","Avenge them.
"
5,3,193,"00:18:28,120","00:18:29,507","How do we get through there?
"
5,3,194,"00:18:30,107","00:18:31,145","We don't.
"
5,3,195,"00:18:31,470","00:18:32,483","We go around.
"
5,3,196,"00:18:32,770","00:18:34,707","It sets miles out of the way.
"
5,3,197,"00:18:35,857","00:18:38,133","- We'll lose sight of them.
- Doesn't matter.
"
5,3,198,"00:18:38,253","00:18:39,513","I know where they're going.
"
5,3,199,"00:18:44,050","00:18:45,813","Don't you get a bit old for a squire?
"
5,3,200,"00:18:50,751","00:18:52,763","How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
"
5,3,201,"00:18:53,639","00:18:54,789","He hates that nickname.
"
5,3,202,"00:18:54,909","00:18:57,226","Well, he's not here to
complain about it, is he?
"
5,3,203,"00:19:01,838","00:19:05,326","I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.
"
5,3,204,"00:19:05,446","00:19:06,426","One night,
"
5,3,205,"00:19:06,938","00:19:08,588","he had a bit too much to drink.
"
5,3,206,"00:19:08,708","00:19:11,038","And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.
"
5,3,207,"00:19:11,497","00:19:13,597","- He borrowed it?
- He wasn't a thief.
"
5,3,208,"00:19:13,863","00:19:16,325","He was drunk and hungry
and he wasn't thinking.
"
5,3,209,"00:19:16,445","00:19:17,700","I was drunk too.
"
5,3,210,"00:19:18,563","00:19:19,937","He gave me half the ham.
"
5,3,211,"00:19:21,863","00:19:23,200","Next morning,
"
5,3,212,"00:19:23,756","00:19:25,993","one of the guards saw him passed out,
"
5,3,213,"00:19:26,290","00:19:28,728","under a wagon, with the ham
bone still in his hand.
"
5,3,214,"00:19:30,097","00:19:31,589","They hanged the man after noon.
"
5,3,215,"00:19:33,230","00:19:34,733","They tied the noose for me too,
"
5,3,216,"00:19:35,008","00:19:37,370","but Lord Tywin heard my
family name was Payne,
"
5,3,217,"00:19:37,490","00:19:38,669","so he pardoned me,
"
5,3,218,"00:19:39,104","00:19:41,579","and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.
"
5,3,219,"00:19:41,699","00:19:43,017","Punishment?
"
5,3,220,"00:19:43,880","00:19:46,255","- For both of you.
- It didn't seem that way.
"
5,3,221,"00:19:46,817","00:19:48,742","Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
"
5,3,222,"00:19:48,862","00:19:51,104","I guess all of your lords
were very kind to you.
"
5,3,223,"00:19:51,224","00:19:52,791","All except me.
"
5,3,224,"00:19:52,911","00:19:55,357","Sorry you have to squire
such a nasty person.
"
5,3,225,"00:19:55,477","00:19:57,945","I'm not sorry. You're the
best fighter I've ever seen.
"
5,3,226,"00:19:58,520","00:19:59,458","You beat The Hound.
"
5,3,227,"00:20:01,247","00:20:02,810","I'm proud to be your squire.
"
5,3,228,"00:20:08,013","00:20:10,017","I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
"
5,3,229,"00:20:10,137","00:20:12,878","If you wouldn't snap at me
I wouldn't learn anything.
"
5,3,230,"00:20:16,693","00:20:19,125","You want to be a knight, Pod?
"
5,3,231,"00:20:20,234","00:20:20,871","Yes.
"
5,3,232,"00:20:20,991","00:20:23,597","Starting tomorrow, we'll train
with the sword twice a day,
"
5,3,233,"00:20:23,717","00:20:26,544","before we ride in the morning and
after we camp for the evening.
"
5,3,234,"00:20:27,492","00:20:29,392","And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.
"
5,3,235,"00:20:29,512","00:20:30,255","Thank you.
"
5,3,236,"00:20:30,375","00:20:31,521","I can't knight you,
"
5,3,237,"00:20:31,641","00:20:32,962","but I can teach you how to fight.
"
5,3,238,"00:20:32,991","00:20:34,458","I suppose that's more important.
"
5,3,239,"00:20:47,449","00:20:48,599","You weren't a knight, but
"
5,3,240,"00:20:49,399","00:20:51,975","you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon,
weren't you?
"
5,3,241,"00:20:53,437","00:20:54,362","I was.
"
5,3,242,"00:20:55,087","00:20:56,687","Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
"
5,3,243,"00:20:59,471","00:21:00,497","He was.
"
5,3,244,"00:21:02,359","00:21:04,147","But how did you end up serving Renly?
"
5,3,245,"00:21:10,755","00:21:13,368","When I was a girl,
my father held a ball.
"
5,3,246,"00:21:13,488","00:21:16,780","I'm his only living child, so he wants
to make a good match for me.
"
5,3,247,"00:21:17,168","00:21:19,671","He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.
"
5,3,248,"00:21:19,791","00:21:22,421","I didn't want to go, but he dragged me
to the ballroom.
"
5,3,249,"00:21:26,059","00:21:27,346","And it was wonderful.
"
5,3,250,"00:21:30,048","00:21:33,298","None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.
"
5,3,251,"00:21:34,723","00:21:36,923","The shaft each other and threatened to duel
"
5,3,252,"00:21:37,043","00:21:38,910","if they thought it was their turn to dance.
"
5,3,253,"00:21:40,829","00:21:42,142","Whispered in my ear
"
5,3,254,"00:21:42,705","00:21:45,979","how they wanted to marry me and take me
back to their castles.
"
5,3,255,"00:21:48,325","00:21:51,453","My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.
"
5,3,256,"00:21:53,323","00:21:55,383","I'd never been so happy.
"
5,3,257,"00:21:58,778","00:22:01,219","Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.
"
5,3,258,"00:22:03,241","00:22:06,674","And then they all started to laugh, they
couldn't keep the game going any longer.
"
5,3,259,"00:22:07,628","00:22:09,154","They were toying with me.
"
5,3,260,"00:22:10,756","00:22:14,451","Brienne the Beauty, they called me.
Great joke.
"
5,3,261,"00:22:16,000","00:22:19,357","And I realized I was the
ugliest girl alive.
"
5,3,262,"00:22:20,640","00:22:23,216","A great lumbering beast.
"
5,3,263,"00:22:28,044","00:22:32,278","I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon
took me in his arms.
"
5,3,264,"00:22:32,911","00:22:35,223","Don't let them see your tears, he told me.
"
5,3,265,"00:22:35,805","00:22:37,417","The nasty little shits,
"
5,3,266,"00:22:37,729","00:22:39,979","nasty little shits aren't worth
crying over.
"
5,3,267,"00:22:41,954","00:22:44,434","He danced with me and none of the
other boys could say a word.
"
5,3,268,"00:22:46,216","00:22:48,279","And he was the king's brother after all.
"
5,3,269,"00:22:50,768","00:22:52,437","But...wasn't he...
"
5,3,270,"00:22:54,576","00:22:56,797","Lord Tyrion said he was...
"
5,3,271,"00:22:58,262","00:23:00,899","Yes, Pod, he liked men,
I'm not an idiot.
"
5,3,272,"00:23:01,514","00:23:03,467","He didn't love me, he didn't want me,
"
5,3,273,"00:23:03,587","00:23:06,572","he danced with me because he was kind
and he wouldn't see me hurt.
"
5,3,274,"00:23:07,804","00:23:10,129","He saved me from being a joke.
"
5,3,275,"00:23:10,766","00:23:11,754","From that day
"
5,3,276,"00:23:12,516","00:23:14,004","until his last day.
"
5,3,277,"00:23:16,922","00:23:18,985","And I couldn't save him in return.
"
5,3,278,"00:23:22,883","00:23:26,374","Nothing's more hateful than failing
to protect the one you love.
"
5,3,279,"00:23:28,744","00:23:30,972","One day, I will avenge King Renly.
"
5,3,280,"00:23:31,521","00:23:33,322","But you said a shadow murdered him.
"
5,3,281,"00:23:34,971","00:23:36,046","How do you fight a shadow?
"
5,3,282,"00:23:36,308","00:23:38,858","A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.
"
5,3,283,"00:23:40,017","00:23:41,279","I know it was Stannis.
"
5,3,284,"00:23:41,493","00:23:43,325","I know it in my heart.
"
5,3,285,"00:23:46,798","00:23:49,337","Stannis is a man, not a shadow.
"
5,3,286,"00:23:49,826","00:23:51,217","And a man...
"
5,3,287,"00:23:51,852","00:23:53,986","can be killed.
"
5,3,288,"00:23:56,397","00:23:58,276","- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.
"
5,3,289,"00:23:58,576","00:24:00,305","I'd like to speak alone.
"
5,3,290,"00:24:00,425","00:24:05,155","Ollie is my steward now, as I was
Lord Commander Mormont's.
"
5,3,291,"00:24:05,848","00:24:09,872","I want him to attend my meetings,
to learn from men with experience.
"
5,3,292,"00:24:11,885","00:24:13,423","One day, he might command.
"
5,3,293,"00:24:17,481","00:24:20,350","Very well. Have you considered my offer?
"
5,3,294,"00:24:22,227","00:24:23,103","I have.
"
5,3,295,"00:24:23,540","00:24:25,603","And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.
"
5,3,296,"00:24:26,896","00:24:29,233","All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
"
5,3,297,"00:24:29,353","00:24:30,513","Say the word and you will be.
"
5,3,298,"00:24:32,987","00:24:34,524","But I have to refuse you.
"
5,3,299,"00:24:36,030","00:24:38,305","I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
"
5,3,300,"00:24:38,919","00:24:39,957","My place is here.
"
5,3,301,"00:24:40,332","00:24:42,707","I'm giving you a chance
to avenge your family.
"
5,3,302,"00:24:44,264","00:24:46,828","Take back the castle where you grew up.
"
5,3,303,"00:24:48,805","00:24:50,246","To rule the North.
"
5,3,304,"00:24:50,913","00:24:52,675","I wish I could fight beside you.
"
5,3,305,"00:24:53,675","00:24:55,013","Believe me, I do.
"
5,3,306,"00:24:55,569","00:24:58,232","But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood.
"
5,3,307,"00:24:59,125","00:25:01,475","I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.
"
5,3,308,"00:25:01,700","00:25:03,588","You're as stubborn as your father.
"
5,3,309,"00:25:05,050","00:25:06,175","And as honorable.
"
5,3,310,"00:25:06,712","00:25:08,174","I can imagine no higher praise.
"
5,3,311,"00:25:08,294","00:25:09,637","I didn't mean it as praise.
"
5,3,312,"00:25:10,050","00:25:11,612","Honor got your father killed.
"
5,3,313,"00:25:12,693","00:25:14,681","But if your mind is made up,
I won't try to persuade you.
"
5,3,314,"00:25:14,801","00:25:16,219","Can I ask Your Grace
"
5,3,315,"00:25:16,339","00:25:17,979","how long you plan to stay
at Castle Black?
"
5,3,316,"00:25:18,015","00:25:19,471","Are you bored of us already?
"
5,3,317,"00:25:21,345","00:25:23,071","You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
"
5,3,318,"00:25:23,383","00:25:24,783","We will never forget that.
"
5,3,319,"00:25:25,270","00:25:26,808","But it's a question of survival.
"
5,3,320,"00:25:27,070","00:25:31,739","Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.
"
5,3,321,"00:25:32,666","00:25:34,454","Mm, winter is coming.
"
5,3,322,"00:25:36,372","00:25:37,298","I know it.
"
5,3,323,"00:25:37,823","00:25:39,923","We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.
"
5,3,324,"00:25:40,197","00:25:41,860","Before the snows trap us here.
"
5,3,325,"00:25:43,103","00:25:44,453","And the wildlings?
"
5,3,326,"00:25:44,703","00:25:46,915","They'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.
"
5,3,327,"00:25:47,035","00:25:48,577","I leave their fate to you.
"
5,3,328,"00:25:49,465","00:25:51,715","You could execute them,
that's the safest course.
"
5,3,329,"00:25:56,457","00:25:58,981","Or you could see if this Tormund fellow
is more willing
"
5,3,330,"00:25:59,101","00:26:01,037","to compromise than Mance ever was.
"
5,3,331,"00:26:01,157","00:26:04,318","I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.
"
5,3,332,"00:26:04,531","00:26:06,019","Most of the brothers, yes.
"
5,3,333,"00:26:07,491","00:26:09,604","There's little love for the free folk here.
"
5,3,334,"00:26:10,291","00:26:11,617","You're Lord Commander.
"
5,3,335,"00:26:11,979","00:26:13,067","Your decision.
"
5,3,336,"00:26:15,344","00:26:16,953","You have many enemies in Castle Black.
"
5,3,337,"00:26:17,073","00:26:19,969","Have you considered sending
Alliser Thorne elsewhere?
"
5,3,338,"00:26:21,514","00:26:23,654","Give him command of Eastwach-by-the-Sea.
"
5,3,339,"00:26:24,092","00:26:26,514","I heard it was best to
keep your enemies close.
"
5,3,340,"00:26:26,634","00:26:28,623","Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
"
5,3,341,"00:26:36,839","00:26:38,370","He sees something in you.
"
5,3,342,"00:26:40,104","00:26:42,417","Might not be apparent from his tone,
"
5,3,343,"00:26:43,229","00:26:45,213","but it's the truth. He believes in you.
"
5,3,344,"00:26:45,333","00:26:47,089","I'm sorry I disappointed him.
"
5,3,345,"00:26:51,839","00:26:54,277","The king is a complicated man.
"
5,3,346,"00:26:55,199","00:26:57,511","But he wants what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.
"
5,3,347,"00:26:57,631","00:26:58,933","As long as he's ruling them.
"
5,3,348,"00:26:59,053","00:27:00,370","He's the one true king.
"
5,3,349,"00:27:01,579","00:27:03,423","He has the blood right to that throne.
"
5,3,350,"00:27:03,543","00:27:06,985","I sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.
"
5,3,351,"00:27:07,105","00:27:08,064","Have you now?
"
5,3,352,"00:27:11,470","00:27:13,860","How does the Night's Watch vow go again?
"
5,3,353,"00:27:14,709","00:27:16,975","I bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.
"
5,3,354,"00:27:19,615","00:27:21,813","Night gathers and now my watch begins...
"
5,3,355,"00:27:21,933","00:27:24,407","Not that bit, the bit at the end.
"
5,3,356,"00:27:25,377","00:27:27,759","I'm the sword in the darkness,
"
5,3,357,"00:27:27,879","00:27:29,673","the watcher on the walls,
"
5,3,358,"00:27:29,793","00:27:32,252","the shield that guards the realm of men.
"
5,3,359,"00:27:32,372","00:27:33,922","- I pledge my life...
- Okay, that's enough.
"
5,3,360,"00:27:34,042","00:27:36,347","Shield that guards the realm of men.
"
5,3,361,"00:27:37,290","00:27:38,740","That's what you swore to be.
"
5,3,362,"00:27:39,190","00:27:40,528","Now I'm not a learned man,
"
5,3,363,"00:27:40,648","00:27:43,008","the best way of helping the most people
might not be sitting
"
5,3,364,"00:27:43,085","00:27:45,252","in a frozen castle at
the edge of the world.
"
5,3,365,"00:27:45,706","00:27:48,718","It just might mean wading in the muck
and getting your boots dirty
"
5,3,366,"00:27:49,212","00:27:51,150","and doing what needs to be done.
"
5,3,367,"00:27:51,270","00:27:52,506","And what needs to be done?
"
5,3,368,"00:27:52,626","00:27:54,519","As long as the Boltons rule the North,
"
5,3,369,"00:27:55,134","00:27:56,572","the North will suffer.
"
5,3,370,"00:27:57,947","00:27:59,072","Just one man's opinion.
"
5,3,371,"00:28:29,272","00:28:30,172","What do you want?
"
5,3,372,"00:28:31,247","00:28:32,210","Who are you?
"
5,3,373,"00:28:33,884","00:28:34,784","What?
"
5,3,374,"00:28:34,904","00:28:37,724","You, who walk in here
with a coin you never earned,
"
5,3,375,"00:28:37,844","00:28:39,596","whose value you do not respect.
"
5,3,376,"00:28:45,718","00:28:46,968","Who are you?
"
5,3,377,"00:28:49,820","00:28:52,791","No one. Ou! Cunt!
"
5,3,378,"00:28:52,911","00:28:54,742","A lie, a sad little lie.
"
5,3,379,"00:28:54,862","00:28:56,851","- Who are you?
- I told you, I'm no...
"
5,3,380,"00:28:56,971","00:28:59,078","Do that again and...

5,3,382,"00:29:01,612","00:29:02,886","You're about to find out.

5,3,383,"00:29:04,545","00:29:05,745","What are you doing?
"
5,3,384,"00:29:06,533","00:29:07,495","We're only playing.
"
5,3,385,"00:29:07,958","00:29:08,958","The game of faces.
"
5,3,386,"00:29:09,383","00:29:10,733","That girl is not ready.
"
5,3,387,"00:29:10,853","00:29:11,771","Clearly not.
"
5,3,388,"00:29:12,121","00:29:13,258","I am ready.
"
5,3,389,"00:29:15,173","00:29:16,061","For what?
"
5,3,390,"00:29:16,348","00:29:17,485","For every you want
"
5,3,391,"00:29:17,605","00:29:19,435","to be a Faceless Man.
"
5,3,392,"00:29:19,555","00:29:20,698","To be no one.

5,3,394,"00:29:27,277","00:29:28,801","It belongs to Arya Stark.

5,3,397,"00:29:33,384","00:29:34,977","A man wonders

5,3,399,"00:29:37,425","00:29:40,518","came to be surrounded
by Arya Stark's things?

5,3,400,"00:33:45,176","00:33:47,383","What do you do with them

5,3,406,"00:35:11,898","00:35:13,348","It's an honor to meet you.
"
5,3,407,"00:35:30,633","00:35:32,586","I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
"
5,3,408,"00:35:33,209","00:35:34,409","You must want to wash.
"
5,3,409,"00:35:35,871","00:35:36,547","Thank you.
"
5,3,410,"00:35:40,272","00:35:41,846","Welcome home, Lady Stark.
"
5,3,411,"00:35:44,496","00:35:45,884","The North remembers.

5,3,413,"00:36:02,247","00:36:03,147","Maester Aemon?
"
5,3,414,"00:36:03,497","00:36:05,421","He apologizes for not being here.
"
5,3,415,"00:36:06,521","00:36:07,771","He's not feeling well.
"
5,3,416,"00:36:08,047","00:36:09,209","Take good care of him.
"
5,3,417,"00:36:09,991","00:36:11,256","I will drink it then.
"
5,3,418,"00:36:11,376","00:36:12,256","He'll lose.
"
5,3,419,"00:36:13,656","00:36:15,269","As you all know too well,
"
5,3,420,"00:36:15,389","00:36:17,632","it's long past time to
dig a new latrine pit.
"
5,3,421,"00:36:21,971","00:36:24,283","First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided
to appoint
"
5,3,422,"00:36:24,403","00:36:27,333","a latrine captain to
oversee this crucial task.
"
5,3,423,"00:36:34,888","00:36:35,600","Brian.
"
5,3,424,"00:36:36,588","00:36:38,200","It seems like a good job for a ginger.
"
5,3,425,"00:36:46,180","00:36:47,467","Ser Alliser.
"
5,3,426,"00:36:51,477","00:36:54,353","You have more experience
than any other ranger at Castle Black.
"
5,3,427,"00:36:54,915","00:36:57,190","You proved your valour many times over
"
5,3,428,"00:36:57,310","00:36:59,527","by defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.
"
5,3,429,"00:37:02,743","00:37:04,343","I name you First Ranger.

"
5,3,433,"00:37:18,050","00:37:20,092","Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.
"
5,3,434,"00:37:20,212","00:37:21,955","Restore it as best you can.

5,3,435,"00:37:22,075","00:37:23,440","First Builder Yarwyck can spare...
"
5,3,436,"00:37:23,517","00:37:25,702","I was charged with the defense of
King's Landing
"
5,3,437,"00:37:25,822","00:37:27,623","when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

5,3,439,"00:37:32,257","00:37:34,027","Alright, alright.
"
5,3,440,"00:37:34,147","00:37:35,334","Enough of that.
"
5,3,441,"00:37:36,145","00:37:37,756","You mistake me, my Lord.
"
5,3,442,"00:37:39,582","00:37:42,269","That was a command, not an offer.
"
5,3,443,"00:37:42,719","00:37:45,482","Pack your arms and armour,
say your farewells,
"
5,3,444,"00:37:46,482","00:37:48,045","and ride for Greyguard.
"
5,3,445,"00:37:50,994","00:37:53,632","I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.
"
5,3,446,"00:37:53,994","00:37:56,632","Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

5,3,447,"00:37:57,006","00:37:58,169","I will not have it.
"
5,3,448,"00:37:58,289","00:37:59,502","Did you hear me, boy?

5,3,450,"00:38:01,665","00:38:03,865","You refusing to obey my order?

5,3,451,"00:38:09,798","00:38:12,813","You can stick your order
up your bastard arse.
"
5,3,452,"00:38:20,227","00:38:21,743","Take Lord Janos outside.

5,3,453,"00:38:24,305","00:38:26,008","Ollie, bring me my sword.

5,3,458,"00:39:00,245","00:39:02,312","He's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.
"
5,3,459,"00:39:04,641","00:39:06,031","A disgrace!

"
5,3,463,"00:39:49,686","00:39:51,517","now is the time.
"
5,3,464,"00:39:54,130","00:39:56,449","I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander!

5,3,465,"00:39:56,569","00:40:01,381","We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only
for this, for all I've done and said.

"
5,3,470,"00:40:13,062","00:40:15,406","I'm afraid.
"
5,3,471,"00:40:16,065","00:40:18,653","I've always been afraid.
"
5,3,472,"00:41:02,369","00:41:05,630","You have served us well, my son.
"
5,3,473,"00:41:06,080","00:41:07,252","Thank you, Father!
"
5,3,474,"00:41:07,372","00:41:10,559","Which of the Seven will you worship today?

5,3,476,"00:41:14,912","00:41:16,299","And the Stranger.
"
5,3,477,"00:41:16,419","00:41:19,326","- Two is extra, you realize...
- Yes, yes.
"
5,3,478,"00:41:31,267","00:41:32,224","What are you doing?
"
5,3,479,"00:41:32,537","00:41:35,349","This establishment belong to
Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...
"
5,3,480,"00:41:36,189","00:41:38,298","You have profaned our Faith.
"
5,3,481,"00:41:38,418","00:41:41,215","The Faith of our fathers and forefathers.

5,3,482,"00:41:41,335","00:41:43,441","I am the High Septon of the...

"
5,3,484,"00:41:45,785","00:41:47,515","And you shall be punished.

5,3,485,"00:42:02,138","00:42:04,038","Sinner! Sinner!

5,3,486,"00:42:04,538","00:42:06,226","Sinner! Repent!
"
5,3,487,"00:42:06,346","00:42:08,007","Sinner! Sinner!
"
5,3,488,"00:42:08,127","00:42:10,432","Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
"
5,3,489,"00:42:11,257","00:42:13,507","Sinner! Shame on you!
Sinner!
"
5,3,490,"00:42:14,157","00:42:15,382","Sinner!
"
5,3,491,"00:42:25,904","00:42:28,720","Your Grace, Grandmaester,
Lord Tyrell...
"
5,3,492,"00:42:29,596","00:42:31,620","Uh, it doesn't matter.
"
5,3,493,"00:42:33,083","00:42:35,220","As the High Septon of
the Faith of the Seven
"
5,3,494,"00:42:35,526","00:42:37,163","I give voice to the will of the Gods
"
5,3,495,"00:42:37,283","00:42:39,763","and I am their foremost
servant in this world.
"
5,3,496,"00:42:40,348","00:42:43,548","An insult to me is an insult to the Gods.
"
5,3,497,"00:42:43,601","00:42:46,097","An assault on my person
"
5,3,498,"00:42:46,217","00:42:47,749","is an assault on our very religion.
"
5,3,499,"00:42:47,869","00:42:48,737","You were assaulted?
"
5,3,500,"00:42:48,857","00:42:49,524","I was.
"
5,3,501,"00:42:49,644","00:42:52,052","By those fanatics who
call themselves sparrows.
"
5,3,502,"00:42:52,478","00:42:53,718","And they humiliated me, they...
"
5,3,503,"00:42:53,835","00:42:57,034","they beat me, they left me naked
and bleeding on the cobblestones.
"
5,3,504,"00:42:57,154","00:42:58,784","I am lucky to be alive.
"
5,3,505,"00:42:58,904","00:43:01,869","I heard this all began in
Littlefinger's brothel.
"
5,3,506,"00:43:03,098","00:43:05,948","High Septon, this is a rather
shocking thing to hear.
"
5,3,507,"00:43:06,068","00:43:08,536","I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.
"
5,3,508,"00:43:08,656","00:43:10,952","Even prostitutes may earn
the mercy of the Mother.
"
5,3,509,"00:43:11,072","00:43:14,699","So you were administering to the
needs of these devout prostitutes?
"
5,3,510,"00:43:14,987","00:43:17,362","A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.
"
5,3,511,"00:43:19,674","00:43:21,312","What do you want from us, High Septon?
"
5,3,512,"00:43:21,432","00:43:22,531","Justice!
"
5,3,513,"00:43:23,081","00:43:26,415","I ask that you protect our Faith
by arresting these criminals
"
5,3,514,"00:43:26,535","00:43:28,263","and throw them in the black cells.
"
5,3,515,"00:43:28,383","00:43:30,247","I ask that you execute their leader,
"
5,3,516,"00:43:30,503","00:43:32,040","the so-called High Sparrow.
"
5,3,517,"00:43:32,160","00:43:34,303","He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
"
5,3,518,"00:43:34,423","00:43:37,043","- If he goes unpunished...
- And where do I find this man?
"
5,3,519,"00:43:37,481","00:43:39,019","This High Sparrow?
"
5,3,520,"00:43:49,339","00:43:51,377","I don't think this is a
good idea, Your Grace.
"
5,3,521,"00:43:51,497","00:43:53,852","Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.
"
5,3,522,"00:43:54,412","00:43:56,612","Where can I find the High Sparrow?
"
5,3,523,"00:43:58,497","00:44:01,513","Seven blessings...
"
5,3,524,"00:44:11,976","00:44:13,273","Thank the Gods.
"
5,3,525,"00:44:13,393","00:44:14,867","Just a little more.
"
5,3,526,"00:44:18,367","00:44:19,789","Thank you for the soup.
"
5,3,527,"00:44:23,235","00:44:26,438","The young man said I would find the
High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
"
5,3,528,"00:44:26,860","00:44:28,329","High Sparrow?
"
5,3,529,"00:44:28,657","00:44:30,376","Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?
"
5,3,530,"00:44:30,496","00:44:32,985","Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle.
"
5,3,531,"00:44:33,892","00:44:35,579","So, it's meant to...
"
5,3,532,"00:44:35,923","00:44:38,908","We're often stuck with the
names our enemies give to us.
"
5,3,533,"00:44:39,028","00:44:42,408","The notion that we are all
equal in the eyes of Seven
"
5,3,534,"00:44:42,528","00:44:45,423","doesn't sit well with some
so they belittle me.
"
5,3,535,"00:44:45,765","00:44:49,062","- Seven blessings to you.
- Seven blessings to you, my dear.
"
5,3,536,"00:44:50,140","00:44:53,250","It's only a name, quite
an easy burden to wear.
"
5,3,537,"00:44:53,729","00:44:55,636","Far easier than hers.
"
5,3,538,"00:44:58,481","00:44:59,692","Why no shoes?
"
5,3,539,"00:45:00,024","00:45:03,442","Because I gave them away to
someone who needed them more.
"
5,3,540,"00:45:04,184","00:45:05,630","We all do that.
"
5,3,541,"00:45:05,750","00:45:08,732","It stops us from forgetting
who we really are.
"
5,3,542,"00:45:09,229","00:45:11,303","Is that why you came to King's Landing?
"
5,3,543,"00:45:11,941","00:45:13,116","To remind everyone?
"
5,3,544,"00:45:13,236","00:45:16,216","Everyone? I have a hard
time reminding myself.
"
5,3,545,"00:45:16,838","00:45:18,788","Well, I tell them no one's special.
"
5,3,546,"00:45:18,908","00:45:21,375","They think I'm special for telling them so.
"
5,3,547,"00:45:23,166","00:45:24,453","Perhaps they're right.
"
5,3,548,"00:45:25,609","00:45:27,990","It would be comforting to
believe that, wouldn't it?
"
5,3,549,"00:45:29,365","00:45:31,915","The Gods sent you here to tempt me?
"
5,3,550,"00:45:33,302","00:45:34,252","I hope not.
"
5,3,551,"00:45:35,727","00:45:37,277","I'd assumed
"
5,3,552,"00:45:38,027","00:45:39,814","you'd only come here to arrest me.
"
5,3,553,"00:45:39,934","00:45:42,364","For that incident with the High Septon.
"
5,3,554,"00:45:42,484","00:45:45,141","An unacceptable way to treat
the chosen representative
"
5,3,555,"00:45:45,261","00:45:47,702","of the Gods in this
world, wouldn't you say?
"
5,3,556,"00:45:47,822","00:45:49,635","Hypocrisy is a boil.
"
5,3,557,"00:45:50,334","00:45:52,684","Lancing a boil is never pleasant.
"
5,3,558,"00:45:53,753","00:45:56,894","Although, they could have been more careful
with the blade.
"
5,3,559,"00:45:57,816","00:46:00,269","The High Septon came to speak to me today.
"
5,3,560,"00:46:02,430","00:46:04,980","He doesn't want me to arrest you,
he wants me to execute you.
"
5,3,561,"00:46:07,542","00:46:10,228","I wouldn't presume to know
your thoughts on the matter.
"
5,3,562,"00:46:14,526","00:46:17,272","My thoughts on the matter
align with your own.
"
5,3,563,"00:46:17,392","00:46:21,484","The High Septon's behaviour was corosive,
as was his attitude.
"
5,3,564,"00:46:21,604","00:46:25,218","Having a man like that reside in the Sept
eats away the Faith from the inside.
"
5,3,565,"00:46:26,787","00:46:29,790","So now he resides in the Red
Keep's dungeons instead.
"
5,3,566,"00:46:31,621","00:46:35,245","The Faith and the Crown are the two
pillars that hold up this world.
"
5,3,567,"00:46:35,365","00:46:36,805","If one collapses, so does the other.
"
5,3,568,"00:46:38,397","00:46:41,327","You must do everything necessary
"

5,3,574,"00:47:13,346","00:47:15,768","- How's your work coming along?
- Very well.

"
5,3,577,"00:47:21,785","00:47:23,836","Very good. I'll leave you to it then.

5,3,578,"00:47:24,110","00:47:28,172","Make sure Littlefinger is clear on
the meaning of the word ""immediate"".

"
5,3,582,"00:48:13,136","00:48:14,711","She really is lovely.

"
5,3,585,"00:48:20,007","00:48:23,395","I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa

"
5,3,590,"00:48:34,920","00:48:38,362","Which makes you quite a rare thing,

Lord Baelish.

"
5,3,598,"00:49:05,029","00:49:06,805","I assure you she's still a virgin.

5,3,599,"00:49:07,417","00:49:11,379","Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By
the law of the land, she's no man's wife.

"
5,3,601,"00:49:14,343","00:49:15,823","I leave that to the brothel keeper.

5,3,603,"00:49:18,421","00:49:20,511","I have delivered everything I've promised.
"
5,3,604,"00:49:21,916","00:49:23,916","And you prepared for the consequences.

wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.

from the Queen Mother,

5,4,12,"00:03:33,321","00:03:35,477","we'll get off here not
far from Sunspear.
"
5,4,13,"00:03:36,030","00:03:38,074","Row ourselves to the
Dornish shores overnight.

5,4,15,"00:03:41,880","00:03:43,323","- No.
- I Have

5,4,16,"00:03:43,693","00:03:45,293","The Dornish are crazy.

5,4,17,"00:03:45,329","00:03:47,032","All they want to do is fight and fuck,
"
5,4,18,"00:03:47,062","00:03:50,662","- fuck and fight.
- You should be happy to go back there.

a fuck mad Dornish girl

"
5,4,25,"00:04:05,988","00:04:08,997","But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.
"
5,4,26,"00:04:09,027","00:04:10,751","Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

- I know.

5,4,33,"00:04:31,103","00:04:32,190","Why are you here?
"
5,4,34,"00:04:32,220","00:04:33,756","Why not send 40 mercenaries?
"
5,4,35,"00:04:33,786","00:04:34,833","...or an army?
"
5,4,36,"00:04:34,863","00:04:37,006","Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.
"
5,4,37,"00:04:37,036","00:04:39,536","Because I do not
want to start a war.
"
5,4,38,"00:04:40,709","00:04:44,059","That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.
"
5,4,39,"00:04:46,136","00:04:47,386","It has to be me.
"
5,4,40,"00:04:50,667","00:04:52,967","If I'm putting something
like this together.
"
5,4,41,"00:04:53,108","00:04:54,358","A one-handed man

recognizable faces in Westeros

I'll split him in two.

rebuilding the royal

could front the money,

5,4,62,"00:06:07,026","00:06:08,839","The Crown would pay
us back in time

given us too much.

asked for the vintage.

the temples to the Seven...

5,4,95,"00:08:06,345","00:08:09,495","Perhaps the gods need
a sword of their own.

Targaryens, the faith militant

and souls of the common people?

the Gods themselves.

of the Seven.
"
5,4,105,"00:08:39,074","00:08:41,024","An honor I never expected...

"
5,4,332,"00:26:56,282","00:26:59,132","Never seen so many
people so quiet.
"
5,4,333,"00:26:59,806","00:27:01,406","He rode past his wife
"
5,4,334,"00:27:03,314","00:27:06,764","and he laid a crown with
winter roses in Lyanna's lap.
"
5,4,335,"00:27:06,868","00:27:08,418","Blue was frost.
"
5,4,336,"00:27:12,593","00:27:17,243","How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rheagar chose your aunt?
"
5,4,337,"00:27:19,216","00:27:20,577","Yes... he chose them,
"
5,4,338,"00:27:22,131","00:27:23,931","and then kidnapped
her, and raped her.

5,4,339,"00:27:32,666","00:27:33,666","Come
"
5,4,340,"00:27:34,652","00:27:37,252","Let's speak somewhere

5,4,341,"00:27:42,477","00:27:43,932","Dressed for riding...
"
5,4,342,"00:27:43,962","00:27:44,962","I am.

5,4,345,"00:27:50,577","00:27:51,977","King's Landing?
"
5,4,346,"00:27:52,334","00:27:54,403","Cersei sent for me.
"
5,4,347,"00:27:54,433","00:27:56,783","We mustn't let her

5,4,349,"00:27:58,945","00:28:02,645","You know how hard it is to get with
people you despise, believe me.
"
5,4,350,"00:28:02,979","00:28:04,879","But it won't be for long.
"
5,4,351,"00:28:05,050","00:28:06,500","How do you know?
"
5,4,352,"00:28:07,751","00:28:10,851","Stannis Baratheon garrisons
the Castle Black.
"
5,4,353,"00:28:11,500","00:28:15,348","He'll march South to King's Landing
before the Winter snow block his way.
"
5,4,354,"00:28:15,378","00:28:16,378","But first,
"
5,4,355,"00:28:16,446","00:28:18,346","he has to take Winterfell.
"
5,4,356,"00:28:18,821","00:28:19,821","You don't konw that.
"
5,4,357,"00:28:19,851","00:28:20,851","I do.
"
5,4,358,"00:28:22,137","00:28:24,237","Once he liberates these
lands from the Bolton's,
"
5,4,359,"00:28:24,267","00:28:26,773","he'll rally your fathers
bannermen to his cause
"
5,4,360,"00:28:26,803","00:28:28,716","with the North behind them.
"
5,4,361,"00:28:28,746","00:28:31,521","Stannis can finally
take the Iron Throne.
"
5,4,362,"00:28:31,551","00:28:34,151","You think he'll
defeat the Bolton's?
"
5,4,363,"00:28:34,397","00:28:36,002","He has a larger army,
"
5,4,364,"00:28:36,032","00:28:38,571","and the finest military
commander in Westeros.
"
5,4,365,"00:28:38,601","00:28:42,251","A betting man, would put
his money on Stannis.
"
5,4,366,"00:28:42,474","00:28:45,774","As it happens, I
am a betting man.
"
5,4,367,"00:28:46,189","00:28:47,539","And if you're right?
"
5,4,368,"00:28:47,938","00:28:50,059","Stannis takes Winterfell,
"
5,4,369,"00:28:50,089","00:28:53,327","he rescues you from the most
despised family in the North.
"
5,4,370,"00:28:53,357","00:28:56,337","Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim...
"
5,4,371,"00:28:56,367","00:28:58,417","he names you... 
Wardeness of the North.
"
5,4,372,"00:28:59,742","00:29:00,742","But I...
"
5,4,373,"00:29:01,199","00:29:02,349","I wouldn't...
"
5,4,374,"00:29:02,983","00:29:04,376","Wardeness of the North?
"
5,4,375,"00:29:04,406","00:29:06,606","You are the last surviving Stark.
"
5,4,376,"00:29:07,295","00:29:08,645","He needs you.
"
5,4,377,"00:29:09,376","00:29:12,064","And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacked Winterfell
"
5,4,378,"00:29:12,094","00:29:14,894","or he does, and the
Bolton's defeat him?
"
5,4,379,"00:29:15,029","00:29:19,179","Then you will take this Bolton boy,
Ramses, and make him yours.
"
5,4,380,"00:29:19,268","00:29:21,951","- I don't know how to do that.
- Of course you do.
"
5,4,381,"00:29:22,454","00:29:24,154","He's already fallen for you.
"
5,4,382,"00:29:24,879","00:29:26,189","His father frightens me.
"
5,4,383,"00:29:26,219","00:29:27,237","And he should...
"
5,4,384,"00:29:27,267","00:29:28,867","he's a dangerous man.
"
5,4,385,"00:29:30,058","00:29:33,358","But even the most dangerous
men, can be outmaneuvered.
"
5,4,386,"00:29:33,873","00:29:36,473","And you've learned to
manouver from the very best.
"
5,4,387,"00:29:38,803","00:29:40,239","I'll return before too long.
"
5,4,388,"00:29:41,033","00:29:42,683","You be strong, without me.
"
5,4,389,"00:29:51,867","00:29:53,267","The North will be yours.
"
5,4,390,"00:29:55,311","00:29:56,311","Do you believe me?
"
5,4,391,"00:29:59,409","00:30:03,159","I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.
"
5,4,392,"00:31:06,575","00:31:07,575","Breakfast?
"
5,4,393,"00:31:12,158","00:31:14,072","That would've been
a shit way to die.
"
5,4,394,"00:31:14,102","00:31:17,196","As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.
"
5,4,395,"00:31:17,226","00:31:18,226","<I> Aye.</I>
"
5,4,396,"00:31:18,263","00:31:20,463","But your lot have to give
the singers a good ending.
"
5,4,397,"00:31:20,493","00:31:23,401","I don't care what's sung
about me when I'm dead.
"
5,4,398,"00:31:23,431","00:31:24,431","No?
"
5,4,399,"00:31:25,259","00:31:28,159","Two knights, off to
rescue a princess...
"
5,4,400,"00:31:28,208","00:31:31,264","- sounds like a good song to me.
- Sounds like all the rest.
"
5,4,401,"00:31:35,044","00:31:36,294","What about you?
"
5,4,402,"00:31:37,060","00:31:39,169","What shit way would you choose?
"
5,4,403,"00:31:40,533","00:31:43,184","In my own Keep,
drinking my own wine.
"
5,4,404,"00:31:43,598","00:31:46,620","Watching my son's
grovel for a fortune.
"
5,4,405,"00:31:47,118","00:31:48,330","How disappointing...
"
5,4,406,"00:31:49,612","00:31:52,373","I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.
"
5,4,407,"00:31:53,017","00:31:54,855","I've had an exciting life...
"
5,4,408,"00:31:55,074","00:31:56,835","I want my death to be boring.
"
5,4,409,"00:31:58,836","00:32:00,492","And how do you want to go?
"
5,4,410,"00:32:00,502","00:32:02,524","In the arms of the woman I love.
"
5,4,411,"00:32:06,550","00:32:08,224","She want the same thing?
"
5,4,412,"00:32:13,901","00:32:14,923","Let's go.
"
5,4,413,"00:32:25,459","00:32:27,046","The captain of that ship...
"
5,4,414,"00:32:27,477","00:32:29,859","- what was he, Braavosi?
- Pentosi?.
"
5,4,415,"00:32:30,836","00:32:33,651","- and he's headed to Old Town?
- As I said...
"
5,4,416,"00:32:33,681","00:32:34,681","Why?
"
5,4,417,"00:32:35,161","00:32:37,299","What's to stop him from
ducking down the coast...
"
5,4,418,"00:32:37,309","00:32:39,961","I tell the locals that Jaime
Lannister's in Dorne?
"
5,4,419,"00:32:39,971","00:32:41,167","A bag of gold.
"
5,4,420,"00:32:42,153","00:32:46,480","I'm not sure you understand how much people
hate your family in this part of the world.
"
5,4,421,"00:32:46,521","00:32:47,978","It was a heavy bag.
"
5,4,422,"00:32:48,382","00:32:51,344","And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.
"
5,4,423,"00:32:51,354","00:32:54,159","But you won't be around if he breaks it.
"
5,4,424,"00:33:03,180","00:33:05,213","- How many do you count?
- Four.
"
5,4,425,"00:33:05,815","00:33:07,573","And how many do you think you can take?
"
5,4,426,"00:33:07,583","00:33:09,249","One... if he's slow.
"
5,4,427,"00:33:18,998","00:33:20,761","Fucked in the ass.
"
5,4,428,"00:33:31,180","00:33:32,541","Morning lads!
"
5,4,429,"00:33:33,753","00:33:35,340","Glad we found you.
"
5,4,430,"00:33:36,082","00:33:37,082","Who are you?
"
5,4,431,"00:33:37,583","00:33:38,583","Cooper.
"
5,4,432,"00:33:39,132","00:33:40,415","And this is Darnell.
"
5,4,433,"00:33:40,782","00:33:43,848","- You're from King's Landing?

"
5,4,434,"00:33:45,599","00:33:47,926","Flea Bottom.
Whelped and whipped.
"
5,4,435,"00:33:48,391","00:33:49,435","Why are you here?
"
5,4,436,"00:33:49,445","00:33:53,536","Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.
"
5,4,437,"00:33:53,566","00:33:55,014","It's a near thing, really...
"
5,4,438,"00:33:55,884","00:33:58,203","Thought the sharks would get us.
"
5,4,439,"00:33:59,033","00:34:00,793","There are no sharks in Dorne.
"
5,4,440,"00:34:02,575","00:34:05,249","I could've sworn those
were shark fins.
"
5,4,441,"00:34:06,290","00:34:07,690","Dolphin's, maybe.
"
5,4,442,"00:34:09,340","00:34:11,309","Throw your sword in the sand!
"
5,4,443,"00:34:11,319","00:34:13,472","Boys, there's no need for this.
"
5,4,444,"00:34:13,610","00:34:17,682","Just point us in the right direction,
and we'll find our way home.
"
5,4,445,"00:34:17,948","00:34:20,348","Swords in the sand, now!
"
5,4,446,"00:34:48,115","00:34:50,355","That one should be slow enough.
"
5,4,447,"00:35:43,768","00:35:44,808","Nice move.
"
5,4,448,"00:35:47,217","00:35:48,283","...Luck!
"
5,4,449,"00:35:49,196","00:35:51,044","You had a wonderful teacher.
"
5,4,450,"00:36:04,874","00:36:07,196","I always wanted a
Dornish stallion.

night without tiring.

5,4,452,"00:36:11,646","00:36:14,713","We'll ride to the Water Garden's
with a nice breeze in our face.
"
5,4,453,"00:36:14,773","00:36:16,969","But first, we need to
bury these bodies.

take us to dig all those hole's?

5,4,459,"00:36:30,118","00:36:31,705","Not at all, really.

me at Planky Town, claiming

half a world away?
"
5,4,522,"00:41:17,566","00:41:19,943","Is it possible, that
you were running?
"
5,4,523,"00:41:21,044","00:41:22,631","Why would you be running?
"
5,4,524,"00:41:22,964","00:41:24,899","And why would she
have sent you away?
"
5,4,525,"00:41:25,808","00:41:27,044","Oh, wait!
"
5,4,526,"00:41:28,227","00:41:30,365","You were spying on
her, weren't you?
"
5,4,527,"00:41:31,612","00:41:33,206","It's all coming back to me!
"
5,4,528,"00:41:33,315","00:41:37,271","I was drunk through most of the small
council meetings, but it's all coming back
"
5,4,529,"00:41:37,301","00:41:39,979","You passed notes to
Varys' little birds.
"
5,4,530,"00:41:42,179","00:41:43,847","She found out, didn't she?
"
5,4,531,"00:41:44,624","00:41:46,534","Found out, and exiled you.
"
5,4,532,"00:41:48,115","00:41:51,191","And now you hope to win
back her favor with a gift.
"
5,4,533,"00:41:52,981","00:41:54,358","A risky scheme...
"
5,4,534,"00:41:55,329","00:41:57,301","one might even say, desperate.
"
5,4,535,"00:41:59,358","00:42:02,337","Do you think Daenerys would
execute me, and pardon you?
"
5,4,536,"00:42:03,994","00:42:06,364","I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.
"
5,4,537,"00:42:28,031","00:42:30,184","Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.
"
5,4,538,"00:42:32,089","00:42:33,107","What?
"
5,4,539,"00:42:34,153","00:42:36,292","I was thinking of all the
times your brother made me
"
5,4,540,"00:42:36,322","00:42:40,075","go with him down from the Red Keep,
into the streets of King's Landing.
"
5,4,541,"00:42:40,105","00:42:42,650","- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people,
"
5,4,542,"00:42:42,680","00:42:44,310","he liked to sing to them.
"
5,4,543,"00:42:45,410","00:42:47,278","- He sang to them?
- Yes. (laughs)
"
5,4,544,"00:42:48,494","00:42:50,964","Rhaegar would take a
spot on the hook
"
5,4,545,"00:42:51,210","00:42:53,636","or ithe street of seeds...
and then he'd sang.
"
5,4,546,"00:42:54,269","00:42:55,764","Just like all the
other minstrels.
"
5,4,547,"00:42:55,794","00:42:58,701","- And what did you do?
- I made sure no one killed him.
"
5,4,548,"00:42:59,200","00:43:01,463","And... I collected the money.
"
5,4,549,"00:43:02,139","00:43:04,182","Well... he liked to see
how much he could make.
"
5,4,550,"00:43:04,212","00:43:06,113","- He was good?
- He was very good.
"
5,4,551,"00:43:06,143","00:43:07,431","Viserys never told you?
"
5,4,552,"00:43:07,461","00:43:10,462","He told me Rhaegar was
good at killing people.
"
5,4,553,"00:43:11,182","00:43:12,897","Rhaegar never liked killing...
"
5,4,554,"00:43:12,927","00:43:14,141","he loved to sing.
"
5,4,555,"00:43:14,619","00:43:16,093","And what did you
do with the money?
"
5,4,556,"00:43:16,123","00:43:19,467","Well, one time, we gave it to the
next minstrel down the street.
"
5,4,557,"00:43:19,497","00:43:22,113","One time, he gave it to an
orphanage in Flea Bottom.
"

"
5,4,559,"00:43:24,220","00:43:25,728","he got horribly drunk.

5,5,70,"00:09:08,842","00:09:11,543","Don't say that, Maester Aemon.
"
5,5,71,"00:09:11,628","00:09:16,632","A Targaryen alone in the world
"
5,5,72,"00:09:16,683","00:09:19,218","is a terrible thing.
"
5,5,73,"00:09:22,105","00:09:23,939","Maester Aemon.
"
5,5,74,"00:09:23,973","00:09:26,225","Lord Commander.
"
5,5,75,"00:09:26,276","00:09:29,228","Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.
"
5,5,76,"00:09:44,577","00:09:46,245","How are you feeling?
"
5,5,77,"00:09:46,296","00:09:48,914","Oh, like
a hundred-year-old man
"
5,5,78,"00:09:48,965","00:09:51,383","slowly freezing to death.
"
5,5,79,"00:09:55,638","00:09:58,557","I need your advice.
"
5,5,80,"00:09:58,591","00:10:01,143","There's something I want
to do, something I...
"
5,5,81,"00:10:01,177","00:10:02,594","have to do.
"
5,5,82,"00:10:02,645","00:10:05,047","But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.
"
5,5,83,"00:10:05,081","00:10:06,683","Bitterly.
"
5,5,84,"00:10:06,932","00:10:09,437","Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.
"
5,5,85,"00:10:10,144","00:10:13,779","Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.
"
5,5,86,"00:10:13,813","00:10:15,864","Do it.
"
5,5,87,"00:10:15,898","00:10:17,727","But you don't know what it is.
"
5,5,88,"00:10:17,847","00:10:19,551","That doesn't matter.
"
5,5,89,"00:10:19,586","00:10:20,954","You do.
"
5,5,90,"00:10:23,740","00:10:27,793","You will find little joy
in your command.
"
5,5,91,"00:10:27,827","00:10:30,379","But with luck,
"
5,5,92,"00:10:30,413","00:10:33,975","you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.
"
5,5,93,"00:10:35,990","00:10:39,588","Kill the boy, Jon Snow.
"
5,5,94,"00:10:39,639","00:10:43,141","Winter is almost upon us.

"
5,5,102,"00:11:16,520","00:11:18,588","What about you?
"
5,5,103,"00:11:19,991","00:11:22,525","Hard to lead
when you're in chains.
"
5,5,104,"00:11:26,113","00:11:27,814","What if I unchained you?
"
5,5,105,"00:11:27,865","00:11:29,181","Why would you do that?
"
5,5,106,"00:11:30,918","00:11:33,820","Because you are not my enemy.
"
5,5,107,"00:11:33,871","00:11:35,538","And I'm not yours.
"
5,5,108,"00:11:35,573","00:11:38,458","You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.
"
5,5,109,"00:11:38,492","00:11:41,244","For 8,000 years the Night's
Watch have sworn an oath

5,5,110,"00:11:41,295","00:11:44,295","to be the shield that
guards the realms of men.
"
5,5,111,"00:11:45,266","00:11:48,468","And for 8,000 years we've
fallen short of that oath.

5,5,112,"00:11:48,502","00:11:51,588","You belong to the realms of men.
"
5,5,113,"00:11:51,622","00:11:53,590","All of you.
"
5,5,114,"00:11:53,592","00:11:56,426","And now everything
is going to change?
"
5,5,115,"00:11:56,428","00:11:58,428","- It is.
- Why now?
"
5,5,116,"00:11:58,479","00:12:02,482","Because now I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.
"
5,5,117,"00:12:02,516","00:12:05,652","What would you have me do,
"

"
5,5,119,"00:12:09,774","00:12:11,858","I'd have you go
north of the Wall.
"
5,5,120,"00:12:11,909","00:12:15,695","Gather the remaining free folk wherever
they are and bring them back here.
"
5,5,121,"00:12:15,746","00:12:19,282","I'll open the gates for
them and let them through.
"
5,5,122,"00:12:19,333","00:12:22,419","I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.
"
5,5,123,"00:12:22,453","00:12:26,039","They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.
"
5,5,124,"00:12:26,090","00:12:28,958","I don't want them
to kneel for me.
"
5,5,125,"00:12:28,960","00:12:31,461","I want them to fight with
me when the time comes.

5,5,126,"00:12:31,463","00:12:34,264","The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows
"
5,5,127,"00:12:34,298","00:12:37,217","is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly
"
5,5,128,"00:12:37,268","00:12:38,301","and make me eat them.
"
5,5,129,"00:12:38,352","00:12:41,271","And how many of your
people can't fight?
"
5,5,130,"00:12:41,305","00:12:44,391","The women, the children,
the old, the sick--

5,5,131,"00:12:44,442","00:12:46,276","what happens to them?
"
5,5,132,"00:12:46,310","00:12:48,361","You're condemning them to death.
"
5,5,133,"00:12:48,396","00:12:52,182","Worse than death because you're
too proud to make peace.
"
5,5,134,"00:12:55,619","00:12:57,721","Or maybe you're not proud.
"
5,5,135,"00:12:59,657","00:13:01,241","Maybe you're just a coward.
"
5,5,136,"00:13:08,165","00:13:11,251","Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.
"
5,5,137,"00:13:35,743","00:13:37,410","Your people need a leader.
"
5,5,138,"00:13:37,445","00:13:40,697","And they need to get south of
the Wall before it's too late.
"
5,5,139,"00:13:40,699","00:13:42,832","We don't have much time
and they have less.
"
5,5,140,"00:13:42,867","00:13:45,785","The walkers are coming and
they'll hit your people first.
"
5,5,141,"00:13:47,538","00:13:50,373","I'm not asking you to make
peace to save your skin.

5,5,142,"00:13:50,424","00:13:54,210","Make peace to save your people.
"
5,5,143,"00:14:02,636","00:14:04,888","Most of them are at Hardhome.
"
5,5,144,"00:14:04,922","00:14:06,222","You know where that is?
"
5,5,145,"00:14:06,224","00:14:08,108","Up on Storrold's Point.

"
5,5,148,"00:14:12,279","00:14:13,897","We'll need ships.
"
5,5,149,"00:14:15,366","00:14:17,901","I'll talk to King Stannis

"
5,5,150,"00:14:21,288","00:14:22,872","All right, then.

5,5,158,"00:14:53,437","00:14:56,940","Men, women, and children will die
by the thousands if we do nothing.
"
5,5,159,"00:14:56,991","00:15:00,193","Let them die. We got our
own to worry about.

5,5,163,"00:15:07,751","00:15:11,588","Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

5,5,164,"00:15:11,622","00:15:13,957","Land that no one uses now.
"
5,5,165,"00:15:13,959","00:15:16,009","A dozen abandoned villages.

abandoned those villages?
"
5,5,167,"00:15:18,212","00:15:21,491","<i>Because the wildlings</i>

5,5,169,"00:15:23,622","00:15:25,304","Just like they did this boy's people.

5,5,239,"00:20:34,061","00:20:37,147","That will involve looking

"
5,5,241,"00:20:43,704","00:20:45,405","And I meant it.

5,5,404,"00:35:14,719","00:35:17,554","She had me, she died.
"
5,5,405,"00:35:18,722","00:35:21,409","And here we are.
"
5,5,406,"00:35:21,529","00:35:23,766","She was a peasant girl.
"
5,5,407,"00:35:24,175","00:35:26,602","Pretty in a common sort of way.
"
5,5,408,"00:35:26,604","00:35:28,845","She was the miller's wife.
"
5,5,409,"00:35:28,965","00:35:32,322","Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent.
"
5,5,410,"00:35:32,596","00:35:34,304","So I had him hanged
"
5,5,411,"00:35:34,424","00:35:37,863","and I took her beneath the
tree where he was swaying.
"
5,5,412,"00:35:37,914","00:35:39,373","She fought me the whole time.
"
5,5,413,"00:35:39,493","00:35:42,167","She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.
"
5,5,414,"00:35:42,202","00:35:44,364","<i>A year later</i>

5,5,418,"00:35:50,805","00:35:53,212","and the child
thrown in the river.
"
5,5,419,"00:35:58,261","00:36:00,102","But then I looked at you

5,5,420,"00:36:00,136","00:36:03,072","<i>and I saw then what I see now.

"
5,5,424,"00:36:23,386","00:36:26,053","He wants the Iron Throne,
"
5,5,425,"00:36:26,055","00:36:29,546","and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.
"
5,5,426,"00:36:30,552","00:36:33,583","He means to take the North.
"
5,5,427,"00:36:35,252","00:36:37,470","But the North is ours.

5,6,586,"00:44:28,078","00:44:30,663","Let's see, there was Kyra

5,6,588,"00:44:32,750","00:44:35,285","She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

5,6,589,"00:44:35,336","00:44:39,789","But she talked
and talked and talked

5,6,590,"00:44:39,840","00:44:43,209","and Ramsay grew tired of that.
"
5,6,591,"00:44:43,260","00:44:45,762","Then there was Violet.
"
5,6,592,"00:44:45,796","00:44:48,298","She had gorgeous blonde hair.
"
5,6,593,"00:44:48,349","00:44:51,301","But she got pregnant.
"
5,6,594,"00:44:51,303","00:44:54,220","And, well, that was boring.
"
5,6,595,"00:44:54,271","00:44:57,941","Then Tansy.
"
5,6,596,"00:44:57,975","00:44:59,609","Such a sweet girl.
"
5,6,597,"00:44:59,643","00:45:04,814","Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

"
5,6,599,"00:45:06,984","00:45:09,285","Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.
"

5,6,601,"00:45:10,487","00:45:12,322","Mmm.
"
5,6,602,"00:45:14,375","00:45:18,661","Have you ever seen a body after
the dogs have been at it?
"
5,6,603,"00:45:18,712","00:45:20,580","Not so pretty.
"
5,6,604,"00:45:22,549","00:45:25,718","But, well, it's your
wedding day.
"
5,6,605,"00:45:26,134","00:45:28,253","Why am I talking
about such things?
"
5,6,606,"00:45:30,557","00:45:32,342","What was your name again?

5,6,607,"00:45:32,393","00:45:34,010","Myranda.

5,6,608,"00:45:36,230","00:45:38,848","And how long have yo
loved him, Myranda?

5,6,609,"00:45:42,236","00:45:45,357","Did you imagine that he would be
with you forever, is that it?
"
5,6,610,"00:45:45,406","00:45:47,573","And I came along and ruined it.

"
5,7,220,"00:20:16,274","00:20:17,841","After all that you've seen.
"
5,7,221,"00:20:18,109","00:20:19,576","There must be another way.
"
5,7,222,"00:20:19,877","00:20:22,179","- Leeches or--
- There is only one way.
"
5,7,223,"00:20:22,547","00:20:26,149","You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

5,7,224,"00:20:26,517","00:20:28,318","Only you can lead
the living against the dead.

to this moment.

- She's my daughter.
"
5,7,227,"00:20:36,560","00:20:38,594","Get out.
"
5,7,228,"00:21:00,884","00:21:02,284","There's always
some sort of grub on.
"
5,7,229,"00:21:02,585","00:21:04,486","A bit of mutton would be nice.
"
5,7,230,"00:21:08,158","00:21:12,027","A beauty from beyond the Wall.
"
5,7,231,"00:21:12,461","00:21:14,981","Where you going, love? Aren't we
better-looking than the fat man?
"
5,7,232,"00:21:14,997","00:21:17,765","No, the question is is she pretty
down south in the real world
"
5,7,233,"00:21:18,133","00:21:20,053","or is she pretty 'cause
she's the only girl here?
"
5,7,234,"00:21:20,069","00:21:21,736","Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.
"
5,7,235,"00:21:22,004","00:21:24,772","Come on, love, give us a kiss.
"
5,7,236,"00:21:25,274","00:21:27,676","- Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

"
5,7,240,"00:21:37,785","00:21:39,553","We just want a little affection.

"
5,7,242,"00:21:43,758","00:21:45,559","Get your hands off her.

not here to save you.

- You're not.
"
5,7,273,"00:23:32,562","00:23:34,931","Just a bit woozy.

5,7,277,"00:24:10,833","00:24:13,001","I know they would have killed
you if Ghost hadn't come.
"
5,7,278,"00:24:13,302","00:24:16,136","No. No, no.
They were tiring out.
"
5,7,279,"00:24:16,437","00:24:18,939","I had them
in the palm of my hand.
"
5,7,280,"00:24:20,175","00:24:22,209","Don't be stupid, Sam.

someone hurting you?
"

fighting pits, my friends.</i>
"
5,7,296,"00:26:56,893","00:27:00,729","Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.
"
5,7,297,"00:27:00,997","00:27:04,132","This one's a Westerosi knight
"
5,7,298,"00:27:04,500","00:27:08,436","from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.
"
5,7,299,"00:27:08,738","00:27:11,006","He fought beside

of the Narrow Sea.
"

with his flaming sword.

to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

"
5,7,337,"00:29:48,159","00:29:50,026","I do.

5,7,350,"00:30:36,372","00:30:40,675","Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

5,7,351,"00:30:40,876","00:30:42,244","I couldn't.

one more suggestion?

bloody fool name he's got?

5,7,544,"00:42:57,323","00:42:59,590","Who's the most beautiful

- No, you're not.
"
5,7,551,"00:44:19,301","00:44:21,202","It felt like the safest place.
"
5,7,552,"00:44:21,470","00:44:23,438","Not for your clientele, clearly.
"
5,7,553,"00:44:24,507","00:44:26,742","It was an establishment
like no other.

5,7,563,"00:44:53,802","00:44:56,136","I should have known

5,7,578,"00:45:34,208","00:45:37,543","Neither silence
nor lies were an option.
"

"
5,7,584,"00:45:51,992","00:45:55,027","The same kind I gave Cersei.

5,8,318,"00:21:04,075","00:21:06,199","To see if you were
the right kind of terrible.

5,8,319,"00:21:06,200","00:21:06,840","Which kind is that?
"
5,8,320,"00:21:06,844","00:21:09,947","The kind that prevents
your people from being even more so.
"
5,8,321,"00:21:11,950","00:21:14,017","Well, I did reopen
the fighting pits.
"
5,8,322,"00:21:14,052","00:21:16,853","Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.
"
5,8,323,"00:21:16,888","00:21:18,622","Yes, that was wise.
"
5,8,324,"00:21:18,656","00:21:21,925","And you agreed to marry someone
you loathe for the greater good.
"
5,8,325,"00:21:21,993","00:21:24,828","Very impressive.
"
5,8,326,"00:21:24,862","00:21:27,397","<i>My own sister married someone</i>

5,8,331,"00:21:45,550","00:21:48,652","It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

5,8,333,"00:21:51,923","00:21:55,425","Yes, he's the one
who convinced me to come find you.
"
5,8,334,"00:21:55,460","00:21:57,060","He was my travelling
companion
"
5,8,335,"00:21:57,095","00:21:59,396","before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

to do to survive.
"

"
5,8,343,"00:22:19,150","00:22:22,386","He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

5,8,345,"00:22:24,322","00:22:27,357","The brother

"
5,8,346,"00:22:27,392","00:22:28,458","That's the one.
"
5,8,347,"00:22:28,526","00:22:30,293","Perhaps I will have you
killed after all.

"
5,8,349,"00:22:34,632","00:22:37,167","I had given up on life
"
5,8,350,"00:22:37,201","00:22:40,637","until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.
"
5,8,351,"00:22:40,705","00:22:43,106","If you chop off
my head, well,
"
5,8,352,"00:22:43,141","00:22:45,175","my final days

and crept forward,

only see its own reflection.

5,9,67,"00:09:40,121","00:09:43,206","But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

5,9,68,"00:09:43,257","00:09:44,925","And burnt him to a crisp.

large men do triumph
"

far more often than not.
"
5,9,424,"00:37:26,703","00:37:29,588","Has your experience ever
involved any actual fighting?
"
5,9,425,"00:37:29,622","00:37:31,256","You yourself?
"
5,9,426,"00:37:31,290","00:37:34,209","Have you ever tried to kill another
man who was trying to kill you?
"
5,9,427,"00:37:36,346","00:37:39,131","Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

skin and bone back then,
"
5,9,429,"00:37:41,884","00:37:45,187","then they saw a pile of angry
muscles ready to murder me.

money out fast enough.
"
5,9,431,"00:37:47,440","00:37:50,892","But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

"
5,9,433,"00:37:54,364","00:37:56,064","And the big men
were always too slow
"
5,9,434,"00:37:56,149","00:37:58,984","to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.
"
5,9,435,"00:37:59,035","00:38:02,871","Yes, whenever I saw a beast like
that one standing across from me

death in the world for my taste.
"
5,9,439,"00:38:23,810","00:38:25,761","I can do without it
in my leisure time.
"
5,9,440,"00:38:25,812","00:38:28,263","Fair enough. Yet it's
an unpleasant question,
"
5,9,441,"00:38:28,265","00:38:32,684","but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?
"
5,9,442,"00:38:32,769","00:38:36,021","It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,
"
5,9,443,"00:38:36,072","00:38:38,824","especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.
"

"
5,9,445,"00:38:40,410","00:38:43,028","I'm talking about the necessary
conditions for greatness.
"
5,9,446,"00:38:43,079","00:38:44,996","That is greatness?
"
5,9,447,"00:38:45,031","00:38:48,950","That is a vital part of the
great city of Meereen,
"
5,9,448,"00:38:49,001","00:38:51,453","which existed
long before you or I
"
5,9,449,"00:38:51,504","00:38:55,590","and will remain standing long after
we have returned to the dirt.
"

5,9,452,"00:39:09,972","00:39:12,274","One day your great city will
return to the dirt as well.
"
5,9,453,"00:39:12,308","00:39:14,559","- At your command?
- If need be.
"
5,9,454,"00:39:14,679","00:39:15,908",
5,9,455,"00:39:19,899","00:39:23,151","And how many people will die
to make this happen?
"
5,9,456,"00:39:23,202","00:39:26,571","If it comes to that, they will
have died for a good reason.
"
5,9,457,"00:39:26,622","00:39:28,707","Those men think they're
dying for a good reason.

"
5,9,459,"00:39:30,543","00:39:32,878","So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

own minds, but you do?
"
5,9,461,"00:39:35,832","00:39:38,834","Well said.
You're an eloquent man.

"
5,10,53,"00:06:05,848","00:06:07,681","I wanted to ask

then she'll die.

trying to protect them.

5,10,196,"00:26:21,930","00:26:23,846","Maybe I'll come
visit you.
"
5,10,197,"00:26:23,898","00:26:25,514","Don't wait too long.
"
5,10,198,"00:26:25,566","00:26:27,266","Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.
"
5,10,199,"00:26:28,353","00:26:30,019","You want a good girl,
"
5,10,200,"00:26:30,021","00:26:32,321","but you need
the bad pussy.
"
5,10,201,"00:26:35,410","00:26:37,660","<i>Whenever you're</i>
<i>ready, my lord.</i>
"
5,10,202,"00:26:53,344","00:26:55,711","Try not to lose it
this time.
"
5,10,203,"00:26:57,715","00:27:00,599","I'll never
take it off again.
"
5,10,204,"00:27:00,635","00:27:03,636","I know you didn't
want to leave Dorne,
"
5,10,205,"00:27:03,721","00:27:05,855","but I'm glad
you're coming home.
"
5,10,206,"00:27:05,890","00:27:07,606","Your mother's desperate
to see you.
"
5,10,207,"00:27:07,642","00:27:10,026","I'm glad Trystane
is coming with us.
"
5,10,208,"00:27:10,061","00:27:11,861","He seems like a nice boy.
"
5,10,209,"00:27:11,896","00:27:13,646","You're lucky.
"
5,10,210,"00:27:13,698","00:27:17,033","Arranged marriages
are rarely so--
"
5,10,211,"00:27:17,068","00:27:19,235","so well arranged.
"
5,10,212,"00:27:19,287","00:27:20,987","Do you think Mother
will like him?
"
5,10,213,"00:27:22,457","00:27:25,875","If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.
"
5,10,214,"00:27:25,910","00:27:27,243","You really believe that?
"
5,10,215,"00:27:27,245","00:27:30,046","Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone
"
5,10,216,"00:27:30,081","00:27:32,415","aside from her children?
"
5,10,217,"00:27:32,417","00:27:34,250","She likes you.
"
5,10,218,"00:27:34,252","00:27:37,136","I'm not so sure
about that.
"
5,10,219,"00:27:37,221","00:27:38,754","Listen...
"
5,10,220,"00:27:40,725","00:27:43,009","there's something
I wanted to tell you.
"
5,10,221,"00:27:44,345","00:27:47,513","Something I should
have told you long ago.
"
5,10,222,"00:27:47,565","00:27:49,398","So...
"
5,10,223,"00:27:51,652","00:27:54,270","now that you've seen
more of the world,
"
5,10,224,"00:27:54,322","00:27:57,990","you've learned how complicated
things can be,
"
5,10,225,"00:27:58,026","00:28:00,109","people can be.
"
5,10,226,"00:28:00,161","00:28:03,446","The Lannisters and the Martells have
hated each other for years,
"
5,10,227,"00:28:03,448","00:28:05,698","but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.
"
5,10,228,"00:28:05,750","00:28:08,451","It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?
"
5,10,229,"00:28:08,503","00:28:10,286","You happen to fall
in love with the man
"
5,10,230,"00:28:10,338","00:28:12,455","you were assigned
to marry?
"
5,10,231,"00:28:12,457","00:28:14,206","My point is...
"
5,10,232,"00:28:16,427","00:28:19,462","we don't choose
whom we love.
"
5,10,233,"00:28:19,464","00:28:21,764","It just, well--
"
5,10,234,"00:28:23,885","00:28:26,385","it's beyond our control.
"
5,10,235,"00:28:26,437","00:28:28,304","- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.
"
5,10,236,"00:28:28,356","00:28:30,890","What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying
"
5,10,237,"00:28:30,942","00:28:32,224","and failing to say--
"
5,10,238,"00:28:32,276","00:28:33,642","I know what
you're trying to say.
"
5,10,239,"00:28:33,694","00:28:36,062","No, I'm afraid you don't.
"
5,10,240,"00:28:36,147","00:28:37,780","I do.
"
5,10,241,"00:28:40,985","00:28:43,652","I know.
"
5,10,242,"00:28:43,654","00:28:45,237","About you and Mother.
"
5,10,243,"00:28:47,658","00:28:50,042","I think a part of me
always knew.
"
5,10,244,"00:28:51,829","00:28:54,797","And I'm glad.
"
5,10,245,"00:28:57,835","00:29:00,419","I'm glad
that you're my father.
"
5,10,246,"00:29:35,289","00:29:37,206","Myrcella?
"
5,10,247,"00:29:39,544","00:29:41,844","Myrcella?
"
5,10,248,"00:29:48,186","00:29:51,103","Myrcella?
Myrcella?
"
5,10,249,"00:31:09,300","00:31:11,467","You love her,
don't you?
"
5,10,250,"00:31:15,473","00:31:17,606","How could you not?
"
5,10,251,"00:31:17,642","00:31:21,060","Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.
"
5,10,252,"00:31:21,112","00:31:24,647","A sellsword from the fighting pits,
a disgraced knight.
"
5,10,253,"00:31:24,649","00:31:26,782","Neither one of you
is fit consort for a queen.
"
5,10,254,"00:31:28,986","00:31:33,072","But we always want
the wrong woman.
"
5,10,255,"00:31:33,124","00:31:35,207","Does he always
talk so much?
"
5,10,256,"00:31:38,045","00:31:40,296","Jorah the Andal.
"
5,10,257,"00:31:40,331","00:31:42,498","Torgo Nudho.
"
5,10,258,"00:31:42,583","00:31:44,049","He should not be here.
"
5,10,259,"00:31:44,085","00:31:45,417","No, but he is.
"
5,10,260,"00:31:45,469","00:31:48,137","Our queen ordered him
exiled from city.
"
5,10,261,"00:31:48,172","00:31:50,422","Our queen would be dead
if not for him.
"
5,10,262,"00:32:12,947","00:32:15,698","<i>Puñila.</i>
Thank you.
"
5,10,263,"00:32:15,750","00:32:18,500","I am sorry.
"
5,10,264,"00:32:18,536","00:32:21,036","Sorry I not there
to fight for our queen.
"
5,10,265,"00:32:21,038","00:32:23,038","You missed a good scrap.
"
5,10,266,"00:32:23,040","00:32:24,040","None of that matters now.
"
5,10,267,"00:32:24,125","00:32:25,507","The longer we sit
here bantering,
"
5,10,268,"00:32:25,543","00:32:28,093","the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.
"
5,10,269,"00:32:28,129","00:32:30,512","He's right.
The dragon headed north.
"
5,10,270,"00:32:30,548","00:32:32,548","If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.
"
5,10,271,"00:32:32,600","00:32:33,682","We?
"
5,10,272,"00:32:33,718","00:32:35,601","You're a Lannister.
"
5,10,273,"00:32:35,636","00:32:38,554","The queen intends to remove
your family from power.
"
5,10,274,"00:32:38,606","00:32:40,306","And I intend
to help her do it.
"
5,10,275,"00:32:40,358","00:32:42,975","You've been here
for how many days now?
"
5,10,276,"00:32:43,027","00:32:44,560","I've fought
for her for years.
"
5,10,277,"00:32:44,562","00:32:46,145","Since she was little
more than a child.
"
5,10,278,"00:32:46,230","00:32:48,447","- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.
"
5,10,279,"00:32:48,482","00:32:50,899","And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.
"
5,10,280,"00:32:50,951","00:32:52,534","The second time
thanks to you.
"
5,10,281,"00:32:52,570","00:32:54,903","Don't blame me
for your crimes, Mormont.
"
5,10,282,"00:32:54,905","00:32:57,623","He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.
"
5,10,283,"00:32:57,658","00:33:00,659","And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.
"
5,10,284,"00:33:00,711","00:33:02,711","Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.
"
5,10,285,"00:33:02,747","00:33:05,247","Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.
"
5,10,286,"00:33:05,299","00:33:08,967","<i>Fine, fine.</i>
<i>I suppose he can join us.</i>
"
5,10,287,"00:33:09,003","00:33:11,553","Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.
"
5,10,288,"00:33:11,589","00:33:14,807","If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.
"
5,10,289,"00:33:14,842","00:33:17,593","Forgive me, but why would
we bring you?
"
5,10,290,"00:33:19,096","00:33:20,429","Pardon me?
"
5,10,291,"00:33:20,431","00:33:22,564","Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?
"
5,10,292,"00:33:22,600","00:33:25,434","Not precisely, but I have other skills
that would be useful.
"
5,10,293,"00:33:25,486","00:33:27,486","Can you fight?
"
5,10,294,"00:33:27,571","00:33:28,937","I have fought.
"
5,10,295,"00:33:28,939","00:33:30,773","I don't claim to be
a great warrior.
"
5,10,296,"00:33:30,775","00:33:32,858","Are you good
on a horse?
"
5,10,297,"00:33:32,910","00:33:34,276","Middling.
"
5,10,298,"00:33:34,278","00:33:36,412","So mainly you talk.
"
5,10,299,"00:33:36,447","00:33:38,614","And drink.
I've survived so far.
"
5,10,300,"00:33:38,666","00:33:42,034","Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.
"
5,10,301,"00:33:43,954","00:33:46,004","You would help us
here in Meereen, though.
"
5,10,302,"00:33:47,124","00:33:48,874","None of us have experience
governing a city
"
5,10,303,"00:33:48,926","00:33:50,125","except for him.
"
5,10,304,"00:33:50,177","00:33:52,177","You want to prove
your value to the queen?
"
5,10,305,"00:33:52,213","00:33:53,545","Prove it right here
in Meereen.
"
5,10,306,"00:33:53,597","00:33:56,348","He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.
"
5,10,307,"00:33:56,384","00:33:57,850","Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?
"
5,10,308,"00:33:57,885","00:33:59,768","They wouldn't.
"
5,10,309,"00:33:59,804","00:34:01,687","They will listen
to Grey Worm.
"
5,10,310,"00:34:01,722","00:34:03,355","I'll come with you.
"
5,10,311,"00:34:03,391","00:34:05,441","I'll find our queen.
"
5,10,312,"00:34:05,476","00:34:07,893","- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.
"
5,10,313,"00:34:07,945","00:34:10,195","He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.
"
5,10,314,"00:34:10,231","00:34:13,365","But you still can't go.
"
5,10,315,"00:34:13,451","00:34:15,117","The people believe in you.
"
5,10,316,"00:34:15,152","00:34:16,952","They know you speak
for the queen.
"
5,10,317,"00:34:16,987","00:34:18,904","It's true.
"
5,10,318,"00:34:18,956","00:34:20,989","Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.
"
5,10,319,"00:34:21,041","00:34:24,326","If you leave, half this city will
consume the other half.
"
5,10,320,"00:34:24,328","00:34:26,578","And Missandei.
"
5,10,321,"00:34:26,630","00:34:29,548","Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.
"
5,10,322,"00:34:29,583","00:34:32,334","Certainly not me.
"
5,10,323,"00:34:32,386","00:34:34,503","The queen's
closest confidante,
"
5,10,324,"00:34:34,505","00:34:37,172","the commander
of the Unsullied,
"
5,10,325,"00:34:37,224","00:34:39,975","and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.
"
5,10,326,"00:34:41,178","00:34:42,644","Good fortune,
my friends.
"
5,10,327,"00:34:42,680","00:34:44,563","Meereen is ancient
and glorious.
"
5,10,328,"00:34:44,598","00:34:46,648","Try not to ruin her.
"
5,10,329,"00:34:48,352","00:34:50,185","Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.
"
5,10,330,"00:34:50,187","00:34:52,271","Let's find
some good horses.
"
5,10,331,"00:34:52,323","00:34:54,690","We have so much
to talk about.
"
5,10,332,"00:35:27,641","00:35:29,641","Hello, old friend.
"
5,10,333,"00:35:31,395","00:35:35,197","I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.
"
5,10,334,"00:35:37,067","00:35:39,868","I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.
"
5,10,335,"00:35:39,904","00:35:42,237","The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,
"
5,10,336,"00:35:42,289","00:35:44,540","if one knows
how to listen.
"
5,10,337,"00:35:45,743","00:35:47,409","They tell me you've
already found favor
"
5,10,338,"00:35:47,461","00:35:49,578","with the Mother
of Dragons.
"
5,10,339,"00:35:49,580","00:35:52,331","Well, she didn't
execute me,
"
5,10,340,"00:35:52,383","00:35:55,717","so that's
a promising start.
"
5,10,341,"00:35:55,753","00:35:57,836","Now the heroes
are off to find her
"
5,10,342,"00:35:57,888","00:36:00,055","and I'm stuck here
"
5,10,343,"00:36:00,090","00:36:03,675","trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.
"
5,10,344,"00:36:03,727","00:36:05,477","Any advice
for an old comrade?
"
5,10,345,"00:36:05,513","00:36:07,012","Information is the key.
"
5,10,346,"00:36:07,064","00:36:09,598","You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.
"
5,10,347,"00:36:09,650","00:36:14,152","You need to learn which of your friends
are not your friends.
"
5,10,348,"00:36:14,188","00:36:17,489","If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.
"
5,10,349,"00:36:17,525","00:36:19,575","If only.
"
5,10,350,"00:36:21,278","00:36:24,363","A grand old city
"
5,10,351,"00:36:24,415","00:36:27,115","choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

5,10,352,"00:36:27,167","00:36:30,118","Who could possibly
have any experience

1,1,117,"00:17:41,707","00:17:43,308","I'm not a Stark.

1,1,118,"00:17:43,342","00:17:45,543","Get on.
"
1,1,119,"00:17:54,620","00:17:57,022","What is it?

1,1,123,"00:19:11,428","00:19:14,763","- It's starting to show.

on the city gates by now.
"
1,1,134,"00:19:44,859","00:19:47,862","Whatever Jon Arryn
knew or didn't know, it died with him.
"
1,1,135,"00:19:47,896","00:19:51,699","And Robert will choose a new

1,1,163,"00:22:06,206","00:22:09,242","You can always say no, Ned.
"
1,1,164,"00:22:17,952","00:22:21,689","We'll need plenty of candles

I hear he's
more than earned it.

1,2,55,"00:06:33,173","00:06:36,309","Bread.

1,2,107,"00:09:58,845","00:10:00,978","I screamed and I battled,

"
1,2,119,"00:11:43,850","00:11:46,952","It's a strange thing,

ahead of time

"
1,2,337,"00:32:08,474","00:32:12,243","- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
"

1,2,341,"00:32:21,553","00:32:25,590","A trader from Garth told me

1,2,343,"00:32:28,026","00:32:30,194","He told me the moon

thousand dragons

1,2,347,"00:32:40,439","00:32:42,373","and they drank
the sun's fire.

"
1,2,349,"00:32:45,344","00:32:48,179","Moon is goddess--

1,2,352,"00:33:02,327","00:33:05,596","Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

1,2,353,"00:33:05,631","00:33:08,833","Men like to talk
when they're happy.
"
1,2,354,"00:33:08,867","00:33:10,902","Before your brother
bought me for you,
"
1,2,355,"00:33:10,936","00:33:13,004","it was my job
to make men happy.

"
1,2,359,"00:33:19,845","00:33:23,281","I did not touch a man

1,2,366,"00:35:35,414","00:35:38,983","What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

fell from that tower.

"
1,2,369,"00:35:47,659","00:35:50,428","The boy was always
sure-footed before.
"
1,2,370,"00:35:50,462","00:35:53,197","Someone tried
to kill him twice.

he wasn't meant to see.
"

to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

the killer used?
"
1,2,377,"00:36:11,483","00:36:13,918","It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.
"
1,2,378,"00:36:13,952","00:36:17,254","The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.
"
1,2,379,"00:36:17,289","00:36:19,190","Someone gave it to him.
"
1,2,380,"00:36:20,592","00:36:24,128","They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

1,2,381,"00:36:24,162","00:36:26,383","If it's war they want--
"
1,2,382,"00:36:26,408","00:36:28,096","If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.
"
1,2,383,"00:36:28,100","00:36:30,968","What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?
"
1,2,384,"00:36:31,003","00:36:32,970","<i>Huh?</i>
"
1,2,385,"00:36:33,005","00:36:35,973","Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

unwanted attention.

1,2,504,"00:47:59,932","00:48:01,658","She's been taken
directly before the King.

"
1,2,513,"00:48:28,519","00:48:31,254","What is
the meaning of this?
"
1,2,514,"00:48:31,322","00:48:34,041","Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

1,2,515,"00:48:34,415","00:48:36,055","How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

"
1,2,517,"00:48:38,229","00:48:41,131","Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.
"
1,2,518,"00:48:41,165","00:48:43,433","But we need to get
this business done quickly.
"
1,2,519,"00:48:43,501","00:48:47,070","Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

1,2,520,"00:48:47,105","00:48:49,740","That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

1,2,521,"00:48:49,774","00:48:51,708","That's not true!
"
1,2,522,"00:48:51,743","00:48:54,211","She just...
Bit him a little.
"
1,2,523,"00:48:54,245","00:48:57,848","- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.
"
1,2,524,"00:48:57,882","00:48:59,783","You and that boy
beat him with clubs
"
1,2,525,"00:48:59,817","00:49:02,686","- while you set your wolf on him.

1,2,526,"00:49:02,720","00:49:04,346","Yes it is!
"
1,2,527,"00:49:04,371","00:49:06,121","They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

other daughter, Ned?
"
1,2,533,"00:49:18,450","00:49:19,802","In bed asleep.

"
1,2,537,"00:49:37,655","00:49:39,723","Tell me what happened.
"
1,2,538,"00:49:39,757","00:49:41,825","Tell it all
and tell it true.
"
1,2,539,"00:49:41,859","00:49:44,494","It's a great crime
to lie to a King.
"
1,2,540,"00:49:52,904","00:49:54,838","I don't know.
"
1,2,541,"00:49:54,872","00:49:58,308","I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.
"
1,2,542,"00:49:59,210","00:50:01,678","- I didn't see.
- Liar!
"
1,2,543,"00:50:01,712","00:50:03,180","- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!
"
1,2,544,"00:50:03,214","00:50:05,515","- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!
"
1,2,545,"00:50:05,550","00:50:09,911","- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

"
1,2,547,"00:50:11,010","00:50:13,742","What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?
"
1,2,548,"00:50:14,264","00:50:16,966","Damn it, children fight.
It's over.
"
1,2,549,"00:50:17,002","00:50:19,604","Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.
"
1,2,550,"00:50:21,273","00:50:24,909","You let that
little girl disarm you?
"
1,2,551,"00:50:30,916","00:50:34,052","Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.
"
1,2,552,"00:50:34,086","00:50:36,955","- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.
"
1,2,553,"00:50:38,190","00:50:40,825","And what of the direwolf?
"
1,2,554,"00:50:40,860","00:50:43,461","What of the beast
that savaged your son?
"
1,2,555,"00:50:46,332","00:50:48,833","I'd forgot
the damned wolf.
"
1,2,556,"00:50:48,868","00:50:51,636","We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.
"
1,2,557,"00:50:51,670","00:50:54,939","No?
So be it.
"
1,2,558,"00:50:54,974","00:50:57,142","We have another wolf.
"
1,2,559,"00:51:00,446","00:51:02,080","As you will.
"
1,2,560,"00:51:02,114","00:51:05,316","- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.
"
1,2,561,"00:51:05,351","00:51:07,786","Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.
"
1,2,562,"00:51:08,921","00:51:11,289","He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?
"
1,2,563,"00:51:11,323","00:51:14,325","No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

it wasn't Lady!
"
1,2,567,"00:51:22,501","00:51:24,002","Is this your command--

than a butcher.

something more appropriate...

and watched.

1,3,107,"00:08:23,749","00:08:27,552","you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

I didn't fight off anything.

I did was scream.

saw it, both of them.

1,3,111,"00:08:34,260","00:08:37,330","That's not true.
You killed the beast.
"
1,3,112,"00:08:37,364","00:08:40,566","You only spared the girl because of the
love your father bears her father.

need to see her on formal occasions

little princes and princesses.

1,3,132,"00:09:40,726","00:09:42,894","I'd double their taxes

1,3,133,"00:09:42,928","00:09:46,430","and command them to supply
10,000 men to the royal army.

1,3,135,"00:09:49,767","00:09:52,101","It's primitive, no better
than the hill tribes.
"
1,3,136,"00:09:52,136","00:09:55,071","We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

experienced soldiers--
"
1,3,138,"00:09:56,974","00:10:00,576","Instead of a mob of peasants who've
never held pikes in their lives.

1,3,139,"00:10:00,610","00:10:03,178","And if the northerners rebel?
"
1,3,140,"00:10:03,212","00:10:04,847","I'd crush them.

1,3,141,"00:10:04,881","00:10:07,583","Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm

1,3,142,"00:10:07,617","00:10:10,552","as Warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.
"
1,3,143,"00:10:10,587","00:10:14,256","And these 10,000 northern troops, would
they fight for you or their lord?

- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
"

invaded their homeland,

his enemies.
"
1,3,152,"00:10:37,611","00:10:40,346","So you agree...

"
1,4,198,"00:14:18,238","00:14:22,008","A man from Asshai with a dagger

other men change their clothes.
"
1,4,201,"00:14:28,651","00:14:32,655","And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

1,4,202,"00:14:32,689","00:14:36,825","and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.

what I have seen:
"
1,4,209,"00:14:56,947","00:14:59,515","Their skulls.
"
1,4,210,"00:14:59,550","00:15:02,686","They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.
"
1,4,211,"00:15:02,720","00:15:05,122","When I was very young,
just three or four,
"
1,4,212,"00:15:05,156","00:15:07,358","my father used
to walk me down the rows
"
1,4,213,"00:15:07,392","00:15:09,126","and I'd recite
their names for him.
"
1,4,214,"00:15:09,161","00:15:11,997","When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

1,4,215,"00:15:13,666","00:15:16,801","The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch
"
1,4,216,"00:15:16,835","00:15:18,636","and they were all
stunted and wrong.
"
1,4,217,"00:15:18,670","00:15:21,940","Skulls no bigger
than dog skulls.
"
1,4,218,"00:15:21,974","00:15:26,912","But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...
"
1,4,219,"00:15:28,248","00:15:30,282","They got bigger
"
1,4,220,"00:15:30,317","00:15:33,385","and bigger and bigger.
"
1,4,221,"00:15:36,189","00:15:38,690","There was Ghiscar
"
1,4,222,"00:15:38,725","00:15:41,293","and Valryon,

"
1,4,395,"00:24:43,380","00:24:45,514","But someday
"
1,4,396,"00:24:45,549","00:24:47,850","he could be
Lord of a Holdfast
"
1,4,397,"00:24:47,884","00:24:50,118","or sit on
the King's Council.
"
1,4,398,"00:24:50,153","00:24:52,555","Or he might raise castles
"
1,4,399,"00:24:52,589","00:24:55,123","like Brandon the builder.
"
1,4,400,"00:24:55,158","00:24:57,893","Can I be Lord
of a Holdfast?
"
1,4,401,"00:25:02,264","00:25:05,266","You will marry
a high lord
"
1,4,402,"00:25:05,300","00:25:07,301","and rule his castle.
"
1,4,403,"00:25:07,335","00:25:09,702","And your sons
shall be knights
"
1,4,404,"00:25:09,737","00:25:12,338","and princes and lords.
"
1,4,405,"00:25:13,741","00:25:16,409","Hmm?
No.
"
1,4,406,"00:25:17,344","00:25:19,812","That's not me.
"
1,4,407,"00:25:41,937","00:25:44,071","Hello.
"
1,4,408,"00:25:45,574","00:25:48,175","Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new Watch partner.
"
1,4,409,"00:25:50,345","00:25:51,879","I should warn you,
"
1,4,410,"00:25:51,913","00:25:54,782","I don't see
all that well.
"
1,4,411,"00:25:55,950","00:25:57,952","Come stand by the fire.
"
1,4,412,"00:25:59,321","00:26:01,556","- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.
"
1,4,413,"00:26:01,590","00:26:03,958","You're not.
You're freezing.
"
1,4,414,"00:26:15,804","00:26:18,740","I don't like
high places.
"
1,4,415,"00:26:18,775","00:26:20,509","You can't fight.
"
1,4,416,"00:26:20,543","00:26:22,311","You can't see.
"
1,4,417,"00:26:22,346","00:26:25,682","You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.
"
1,4,418,"00:26:27,385","00:26:29,319","What are you
doing here, Sam?
"
1,4,419,"00:26:33,692","00:26:37,394","On the morning of my 18th Nameday,
my father came to me.
"
1,4,420,"00:26:38,630","00:26:40,998","""You're almost
a man now,"" he said...
"
1,4,421,"00:26:42,334","00:26:45,569","""But you're not worthy
of my land and title.
"
1,4,422,"00:26:46,838","00:26:49,140","Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,
"
1,4,423,"00:26:49,174","00:26:52,476","forsake all claim to your
inheritance and start North.
"
1,4,424,"00:26:52,510","00:26:56,914","If you do not,""
he said...
"
1,4,425,"00:26:57,882","00:27:00,083","""Then we'll have a hunt
"
1,4,426,"00:27:00,118","00:27:03,153","and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble
"
1,4,427,"00:27:03,187","00:27:06,023","and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.
"
1,4,428,"00:27:08,526","00:27:11,061","Or so I'll tell
your mother.
"
1,4,429,"00:27:11,096","00:27:13,263","Nothing would
please me more.""
"
1,4,430,"00:27:18,436","00:27:21,538","Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
"
1,4,431,"00:27:22,707","00:27:24,842","Yes, he is.
"
1,4,432,"00:27:24,876","00:27:27,645","I'm not going to get
any better, you know?
"
1,4,433,"00:27:29,081","00:27:30,982","Well...
"
1,4,434,"00:27:31,016","00:27:32,817","You can't get any worse.
"
1,4,435,"00:27:42,593","00:27:45,394","I hear you're reading
a boring book.
"
1,4,436,"00:27:45,429","00:27:47,229","Hmph.
"
1,4,437,"00:27:47,264","00:27:49,398","Pycelle talks too much.
"
1,4,438,"00:27:49,432","00:27:51,333","Oh, he never stops.
"
1,4,439,"00:27:51,367","00:27:53,868","Do you know Ser Hugh
of the Vale?
"
1,4,440,"00:27:55,004","00:27:57,405","Not surprising.
Until recently,
"
1,4,441,"00:27:57,440","00:28:00,975","he was only a squire--
Jon Arryn's squire.
"
1,4,442,"00:28:01,010","00:28:02,977","He was knighted
almost immediately
"
1,4,443,"00:28:03,012","00:28:05,413","after his master's
untimely death.
"
1,4,444,"00:28:05,447","00:28:07,749","Knighted for what?
"
1,4,445,"00:28:08,717","00:28:10,351","Why are you
telling me this?
"
1,4,446,"00:28:10,385","00:28:12,086","I promised cat
that I'd help you.
"
1,4,447,"00:28:12,120","00:28:14,588","Where is Ser Hugh?
"
1,4,448,"00:28:14,623","00:28:17,524","- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.
"
1,4,449,"00:28:17,559","00:28:19,726","Do you see
that boy there?
"
1,4,450,"00:28:19,761","00:28:22,395","One of Varys's little birds.
"
1,4,451,"00:28:22,430","00:28:26,232","The spider has taken a great
interest in your comings and goings.
"
1,4,452,"00:28:26,266","00:28:28,167","Now look there.
"
1,4,453,"00:28:28,202","00:28:30,936","That one belongs
to the Queen.
"
1,4,454,"00:28:30,971","00:28:34,106","And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?
"
1,4,455,"00:28:34,140","00:28:37,008","Varys or the Queen?
"
1,4,456,"00:28:37,042","00:28:39,744","No, she's one
of mine.
"
1,4,457,"00:28:41,446","00:28:44,681","Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?
"
1,4,458,"00:28:46,750","00:28:50,186","- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, My Lord.
"
1,4,459,"00:28:51,321","00:28:54,224","Get a message to
this paragon of yours--
"
1,4,460,"00:28:54,258","00:28:57,427","discreetly--
send him to question Ser Hugh.
"
1,4,461,"00:28:57,461","00:29:01,699","After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.
"
1,4,462,"00:29:01,733","00:29:05,336","He lives in a large house at the top
of the Street of Steel.
"
1,4,463,"00:29:05,370","00:29:07,772","- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,
"
1,4,464,"00:29:07,807","00:29:10,308","and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn
"
1,4,465,"00:29:10,343","00:29:14,246","visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.
"
1,4,466,"00:29:15,848","00:29:18,883","Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
wrong to distrust you.
"
1,4,467,"00:29:18,918","00:29:20,785","Distrusting me was
the wisest thing
"
1,4,468,"00:29:20,820","00:29:23,421","you've done since you climbed
off your horse.
"
1,4,469,"00:29:29,894","00:29:33,029","...Two, three,
"
1,4,470,"00:29:33,063","00:29:34,864","24, five,

1,4,471,"00:29:34,899","00:29:37,200","six, 27,
"
1,4,472,"00:29:37,234","00:29:39,235","- 28, 29--
- Ser Hugh?
"
1,4,473,"00:29:39,270","00:29:40,938","30, 31, 32
"
1,4,474,"00:29:40,972","00:29:43,240","- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.
"
1,4,475,"00:29:43,274","00:29:46,210","I'm here on behalf
of Lord Eddard Stark,
"
1,4,476,"00:29:46,245","00:29:48,513","the Hand of the King.
"
1,4,477,"00:29:48,547","00:29:49,947","I'm the Captain
of his guard.
"
1,4,478,"00:29:49,982","00:29:52,150","I'm sorry, I didn't catch
your name, Ser...
"
1,4,479,"00:29:52,184","00:29:54,853","No ""Ser.""
I'm not a knight.
"
1,4,480,"00:29:54,887","00:29:58,189","I see. Well, it just
so happens that I am.
"
1,4,481,"00:30:02,927","00:30:05,896","He said he'd be glad
to talk to the hand himself.
"
1,4,482,"00:30:05,930","00:30:07,764","He's a <i>knight,</i>
you see.
"
1,4,483,"00:30:07,798","00:30:09,532","Ah, a knight.
"
1,4,484,"00:30:09,566","00:30:12,434","They strut around
like roosters down here.
"
1,4,485,"00:30:12,469","00:30:16,138","<i>Even the ones who've never seen</i>
<i>an arrow coming their way.</i>
"
1,4,486,"00:30:16,172","00:30:18,040","You shouldn't be
out here, My Lord.
"
1,4,487,"00:30:18,074","00:30:21,510","- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.
"
1,4,488,"00:30:23,513","00:30:26,348","The former Hand did call on me,
My Lord, several times.
"
1,4,489,"00:30:26,383","00:30:29,718","I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.
"
1,4,490,"00:30:29,753","00:30:32,287","What did
Lord Arryn want?
"
1,4,491,"00:30:32,322","00:30:34,389","He always came to see the boy.
"
1,4,492,"00:30:34,424","00:30:36,325","I'd like to see him
as well.
"
1,4,493,"00:30:38,260","00:30:40,695","As you Gendry! My lord.
"
1,4,494,"00:30:44,499","00:30:46,066","Here he is.
"
1,4,495,"00:30:46,100","00:30:48,735","Strong for his age.
He works hard.
"
1,4,496,"00:30:48,769","00:30:51,905","Show the hand
the helmet you made, lad.
"
1,4,497,"00:31:05,754","00:31:08,523","- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.
"
1,4,498,"00:31:08,557","00:31:10,458","Boy, this is
the King's Hand!
"
1,4,499,"00:31:10,493","00:31:13,896","- If his lordship wants the helm--
- I made it for me.
"
1,4,500,"00:31:13,930","00:31:16,565","- Forgive him, My Lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.
"
1,4,501,"00:31:18,067","00:31:20,802","When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?
"
1,4,502,"00:31:20,836","00:31:23,338","He just asked me questions
is all, My Lord.
"
1,4,503,"00:31:23,372","00:31:25,540","What kind
of questions?
"
1,4,504,"00:31:27,643","00:31:29,944","About my work at first,
"
1,4,505,"00:31:29,978","00:31:33,581","if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.
"
1,4,506,"00:31:35,317","00:31:37,552","But then he started
asking me about my mother.
"
1,4,507,"00:31:38,921","00:31:41,989","- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.
"
1,4,508,"00:31:42,925","00:31:44,759","What did you tell him?
"
1,4,509,"00:31:46,462","00:31:48,530","She died when I was little.
"
1,4,510,"00:31:48,564","00:31:50,798","She had yellow hair.
"
1,4,511,"00:31:50,833","00:31:53,468","She'd sing to me sometimes.
"
1,4,512,"00:31:57,373","00:31:59,241","Look at me.
"
1,4,513,"00:32:08,952","00:32:10,887","Get back to work, lad.
"
1,4,514,"00:32:12,623","00:32:14,624","If the day ever comes
when that boy
"
1,4,515,"00:32:14,658","00:32:16,826","would rather wield
a sword than forge one,
"
1,4,516,"00:32:16,860","00:32:19,261","<i>you send him to me.</i>
"
1,4,517,"00:32:24,034","00:32:26,068","Find anything?
"
1,4,518,"00:32:27,104","00:32:29,905","King Robert's
bastard son.
"
1,4,519,"00:32:32,275","00:32:34,977","<i>He likes that.</i>
"
1,4,520,"00:32:36,480","00:32:39,316","This is for the King
from Lord Stark.
"
1,4,521,"00:32:39,350","00:32:41,585","Should I leave it with--
"
1,4,522,"00:32:41,620","00:32:43,354","shhh.
"
1,4,523,"00:32:43,388","00:32:45,223","Listen.
"
1,4,524,"00:32:45,257","00:32:47,993","Do you hear them?
"
1,4,525,"00:32:50,297","00:32:52,531","How many do you think
are in there with him?
"
1,4,526,"00:32:52,565","00:32:54,366","Huh?
"
1,4,527,"00:32:54,400","00:32:56,201","- <i>Guess.</i>
- Three?
"
1,4,528,"00:32:56,235","00:32:58,536","Four.
"
1,4,529,"00:33:00,238","00:33:02,507","He likes to do this
when I'm on duty--
"
1,4,530,"00:33:02,541","00:33:05,109","he makes me listen
as he insults my sister.
"
1,4,531,"00:33:10,816","00:33:11,639","Forgive me, My Lord--
"
1,4,532,"00:33:11,664","00:33:13,665","Why do I have to forgive you?
Have you wronged me?
"
1,4,533,"00:33:16,187","00:33:17,988","We've met before, you know.
"
1,4,534,"00:33:18,023","00:33:20,992","Have we?
Strange, I've forgotten.
"
1,4,535,"00:33:21,026","00:33:24,463","The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.
"
1,4,536,"00:33:24,497","00:33:26,298","Ah.
"
1,4,537,"00:33:26,332","00:33:28,367","- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.
"
1,4,538,"00:33:28,401","00:33:29,802","Oh.
"
1,4,539,"00:33:29,837","00:33:31,671","One of the Greyjoys
nearly took my eye.
"
1,4,540,"00:33:31,706","00:33:34,675","- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.
"
1,4,541,"00:33:34,709","00:33:36,877","<i>They stopped liking it</i>
<i>at the end.</i>
"
1,4,542,"00:33:36,911","00:33:40,914","That was a proper battle.
Do you remember
"
1,4,543,"00:33:40,949","00:33:43,984","Thoros of Myr charging
through the breach?
"
1,4,544,"00:33:44,019","00:33:45,552","With his burning sword?

1,4,545,"00:33:45,587","00:33:47,455","I'll remember that
till the day I die.
"
1,4,546,"00:33:47,489","00:33:51,326","I saw the youngest of the
Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.
"
1,4,547,"00:33:51,360","00:33:53,728","It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

He's a good lad.

1,4,553,"00:34:10,515","00:34:12,149","The message

1,4,554,"00:34:12,183","00:34:14,518","I don't serve Lord Stark.
"
1,4,555,"00:34:37,539","00:34:40,075","- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.
"
1,4,556,"00:34:40,109","00:34:42,477","- With Sam.
- Ah, prince porkchop.
"
1,4,557,"00:34:42,512","00:34:44,646","- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.
"
1,4,558,"00:34:44,681","00:34:46,348","Impossible!
"
1,4,559,"00:34:46,382","00:34:48,918","That's enough.
"
1,4,560,"00:34:54,125","00:34:56,526","Sam's no different
from the rest of us.
"
1,4,561,"00:34:56,560","00:34:58,862","There was no place
for him in the world,
"
1,4,562,"00:34:58,896","00:35:00,696","so he's come here.
"
1,4,563,"00:35:00,731","00:35:03,166","We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.
"
1,4,564,"00:35:03,200","00:35:06,068","Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.
"
1,4,565,"00:35:06,102","00:35:09,071","He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.
"
1,4,566,"00:35:09,105","00:35:11,773","You <i>are</i> in love, Lord Snow.
"
1,4,567,"00:35:14,243","00:35:17,212","You girls can do
as you please.
"
1,4,568,"00:35:17,246","00:35:20,082","But if Thorne puts me
up against lady piggy,
"
1,4,569,"00:35:20,117","00:35:22,184","I'm gonna slice me off
a side of bacon.
"
1,4,570,"00:35:45,244","00:35:47,946","No one touches Sam.
"
1,4,571,"00:36:02,228","00:36:04,563","What are you
waiting for?
"
1,4,572,"00:36:14,474","00:36:16,875","Attack him!
"
1,4,573,"00:36:25,785","00:36:28,086","You get in there.
"
1,4,574,"00:36:32,058","00:36:33,558","Hit me.
"
1,4,575,"00:36:35,761","00:36:37,762","Go on, hit me!
"
1,4,576,"00:36:39,698","00:36:42,300","<i>I yield!</i>
"
1,4,577,"00:36:42,334","00:36:44,302","Yield yield.
"
1,4,578,"00:36:44,336","00:36:46,570","<i>I yield.</i>
"
1,4,579,"00:36:49,441","00:36:52,443","You think this
is funny, do you?
"
1,4,580,"00:36:55,548","00:36:57,048","When you're out there
"
1,4,581,"00:36:57,083","00:36:59,784","beyond The Wall
with the sun going down,
"
1,4,582,"00:36:59,819","00:37:02,254","do you want
a man at your back?
"
1,4,583,"00:37:02,288","00:37:04,590","Or a sniveling boy?
"
1,4,584,"00:37:19,039","00:37:21,807","You send this whore
to give me commands?
"
1,4,585,"00:37:21,842","00:37:24,376","I should have sent
you back her head!
"
1,4,586,"00:37:24,410","00:37:26,311","Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.
"
1,4,587,"00:37:26,346","00:37:27,946","Hush now.
It's all right.
"
1,4,588,"00:37:27,981","00:37:31,283","- Irri, take her and leave us.
- <i>Yes, Khaleesi.</i>
"
1,4,589,"00:37:34,621","00:37:37,689","- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?
"
1,4,590,"00:37:37,724","00:37:39,324","You do not command me.
"
1,4,591,"00:37:39,359","00:37:41,125","I wasn't commanding you.
"
1,4,592,"00:37:41,160","00:37:42,960","I just wanted to invite
you to supper.
"
1,4,593,"00:37:42,995","00:37:45,263","- What's this?
- It's a gift.
"
1,4,594,"00:37:45,297","00:37:48,233","- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?
"
1,4,595,"00:37:48,267","00:37:50,301","- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.
"
1,4,596,"00:37:50,336","00:37:52,370","This stinks of manure.
All of it.
"
1,4,597,"00:37:52,405","00:37:54,776","Stop-- stop it.
"
1,4,598,"00:37:54,801","00:37:56,271","You would turn me into one
of them, wouldn't you?
"
1,4,599,"00:37:56,275","00:37:57,942","Next you'll want
to braid my hair.
"
1,4,600,"00:37:57,976","00:38:00,010","You've no right
to a braid.
"
1,4,601,"00:38:00,044","00:38:01,511","You've won
no victories yet.
"
1,4,602,"00:38:01,546","00:38:04,681","You do not
talk back to me!
"
1,4,603,"00:38:05,983","00:38:08,484","You are a horselord's slut.
"
1,4,604,"00:38:08,519","00:38:10,453","And now you've woken
the dragon--
"
1,4,605,"00:38:16,093","00:38:19,663","I am a Khaleesi
of the Dothraki!
"
1,4,606,"00:38:19,697","00:38:22,066","I am the wife
of the great Khal
"
1,4,607,"00:38:22,100","00:38:24,869","and I carry his son
inside me.
"
1,4,608,"00:38:24,903","00:38:28,673","The next time
you raise a hand to me
"
1,4,609,"00:38:28,707","00:38:31,943","will be the last time
you have hands.
"
1,4,610,"00:38:39,752","00:38:41,653","I know for a fact
that some of the officers
"
1,4,611,"00:38:41,688","00:38:43,655","go to that brothel
in mole's town.
"
1,4,612,"00:38:43,690","00:38:45,490","I wouldn't doubt it.
"
1,4,613,"00:38:45,525","00:38:47,959","Don't you think it's
a little bit unfair?
"
1,4,614,"00:38:47,993","00:38:50,128","Making us take our vows
while they sneak off
"
1,4,615,"00:38:50,162","00:38:52,763","for a little
sally on the side?
"
1,4,616,"00:38:52,797","00:38:55,566","- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?
"
1,4,617,"00:38:55,600","00:38:58,937","What, we can't defend
the wall unless we're celibate?
"
1,4,618,"00:38:58,971","00:39:00,794","It's absurd.
"
1,4,619,"00:39:00,819","00:39:02,873","I didn't think you'd be
so upset about it.
"
1,4,620,"00:39:04,277","00:39:06,545","Why not?
"
1,4,621,"00:39:06,579","00:39:09,040","- Because I'm fat?
- No.
"
1,4,622,"00:39:09,048","00:39:12,160","But I like girls just
as much as you do.
"
1,4,623,"00:39:13,287","00:39:15,856","They might not
like me as much.
"
1,4,624,"00:39:17,792","00:39:21,061","I've never--
been with one.
"
1,4,625,"00:39:22,396","00:39:24,331","You've probably
had hundreds.
"
1,4,626,"00:39:24,365","00:39:26,033","No.
"
1,4,627,"00:39:28,336","00:39:30,871","As a matter of fact,
"
1,4,628,"00:39:30,906","00:39:32,339","I'm the same as you.
"
1,4,629,"00:39:32,374","00:39:34,374","Yeah.
"
1,4,630,"00:39:34,409","00:39:36,610","I find that hard
to believe.
"
1,4,631,"00:39:36,644","00:39:38,946","I came very close once.
"
1,4,632,"00:39:38,980","00:39:42,415","I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but--
"
1,4,633,"00:39:42,450","00:39:44,751","you didn't know
where to put it?
"
1,4,634,"00:39:44,785","00:39:46,819","I know where to put it.
"
1,4,635,"00:39:46,854","00:39:48,888","Was she...
"
1,4,636,"00:39:48,923","00:39:51,057","Old and ugly?
"
1,4,637,"00:39:52,092","00:39:53,859","Young and gorgeous.
"
1,4,638,"00:39:55,495","00:39:57,396","A whore named Ros.
"
1,4,639,"00:39:59,365","00:40:01,166","What color hair?
"
1,4,640,"00:40:01,200","00:40:04,035","- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.
"
1,4,641,"00:40:05,604","00:40:07,371","And her, um...
"
1,4,642,"00:40:07,406","00:40:09,106","Her...
"
1,4,643,"00:40:10,208","00:40:11,808","- You don't want to know.
- That good?
"
1,4,644,"00:40:11,843","00:40:13,610","- Better.
- Oh no.
"
1,4,645,"00:40:15,313","00:40:17,949","So why exactly
"
1,4,646,"00:40:17,983","00:40:21,686","did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect--?
"
1,4,647,"00:40:21,720","00:40:24,189","What's my name?
"
1,4,648,"00:40:24,223","00:40:26,125","Jon Snow?
"
1,4,649,"00:40:26,159","00:40:29,462","And why is
my surname snow?
"
1,4,650,"00:40:29,496","00:40:32,299","Because...
"
1,4,651,"00:40:32,333","00:40:34,901","You're a bastard
from the North.
"
1,4,652,"00:40:36,570","00:40:38,972","I never met my mother.
"
1,4,653,"00:40:39,006","00:40:41,974","My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.
"
1,4,654,"00:40:42,009","00:40:44,644","I don't know if she's
living or dead.
"
1,4,655,"00:40:46,647","00:40:49,114","I don't know
if she's a noblewoman
"
1,4,656,"00:40:49,149","00:40:50,783","or a Fisherman's wife...
"
1,4,657,"00:40:52,485","00:40:54,486","Or a whore.
"
1,4,658,"00:40:56,723","00:40:59,091","So I sat there
"
1,4,659,"00:40:59,125","00:41:02,328","in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.
"
1,4,660,"00:41:02,362","00:41:05,932","But I couldn't do it.
"
1,4,661,"00:41:05,966","00:41:08,969","Because all I could
think was
"
1,4,662,"00:41:09,003","00:41:11,672","what if I got her pregnant
"
1,4,663,"00:41:11,706","00:41:13,741","and she had a child,
"
1,4,664,"00:41:13,775","00:41:16,710","another bastard named Snow?
"
1,4,665,"00:41:21,249","00:41:24,085","It's not a good life
for a child.
"
1,4,666,"00:41:24,119","00:41:26,320","Ah, mmm.
"
1,4,667,"00:41:29,124","00:41:30,958","So...
"
1,4,668,"00:41:30,992","00:41:33,394","You didn't know
where to put it?
"
1,4,669,"00:41:39,067","00:41:41,202","<i>Enjoying yourselves?</i>
"
1,4,670,"00:41:43,339","00:41:45,140","You look cold, boys.
"
1,4,671,"00:41:46,909","00:41:48,443","It is a bit nippy.
"
1,4,672,"00:41:48,477","00:41:50,879","A bit nippy,
yeah, by the fire,
"
1,4,673,"00:41:50,913","00:41:55,050","indoors.
It's still summer.
"
1,4,674,"00:41:56,218","00:41:58,921","Do you boys even remember
the last winter?
"
1,4,675,"00:42:00,090","00:42:02,725","How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?
"
1,4,676,"00:42:02,759","00:42:04,860","I remember.
"
1,4,677,"00:42:04,895","00:42:07,596","Was it uncomfortable
at Winterfell?
"
1,4,678,"00:42:07,631","00:42:10,266","Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,
"
1,4,679,"00:42:10,300","00:42:13,135","never mind how many fires
your servants built?
"
1,4,680,"00:42:13,170","00:42:16,371","- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.
"
1,4,681,"00:42:17,907","00:42:20,575","I spent six months out there,
beyond The Wall
"
1,4,682,"00:42:20,610","00:42:23,512","<i>during the last winter.</i>
"
1,4,683,"00:42:23,547","00:42:26,649","It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.
"
1,4,684,"00:42:26,684","00:42:30,119","We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.
"
1,4,685,"00:42:30,154","00:42:33,523","So we went out to look
for some of his men--
"
1,4,686,"00:42:33,557","00:42:36,459","capture them,
gather some knowledge.
"
1,4,687,"00:42:36,494","00:42:39,462","The Wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.
"
1,4,688,"00:42:39,497","00:42:42,531","Harder than you'll ever be.
"
1,4,689,"00:42:42,566","00:42:45,000","They know their country
better than we do.
"
1,4,690,"00:42:45,035","00:42:47,370","They knew there was
a storm coming in.
"
1,4,691,"00:42:48,705","00:42:51,674","So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.
"
1,4,692,"00:42:53,243","00:42:55,644","And we got caught
in the open.
"
1,4,693,"00:42:55,678","00:42:57,980","Wind so strong
"
1,4,694,"00:42:58,014","00:43:00,516","it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground,
"
1,4,695,"00:43:00,550","00:43:03,019","<i>roots and all.</i>

"
1,4,697,"00:43:05,089","00:43:07,390","you lost a finger

1,4,698,"00:43:07,424","00:43:09,758","And all in darkness.

1,4,699,"00:43:12,996","00:43:15,464","You don't know cold.

1,4,700,"00:43:15,498","00:43:17,899","Neither of you do.

1,4,701,"00:43:20,036","00:43:22,671","The horses died first.
"
1,4,702,"00:43:24,507","00:43:27,609","We didn't have enough to feed them,
to keep them warm.
"
1,4,703,"00:43:29,879","00:43:32,314","Eating the horses was easy.
"
1,4,704,"00:43:34,283","00:43:37,385","But later when <i>we</i>
started to fall...

1,4,705,"00:43:39,121","00:43:41,389","That wasn't easy.

1,4,706,"00:43:41,423","00:43:44,958","We should have had a couple of

1,4,707,"00:43:50,698","00:43:52,932","Soft, fat boys like you.
"
1,4,708,"00:43:52,967","00:43:55,436","We'd have lasted
a fortnight on you

1,4,709,"00:43:55,470","00:43:58,506","and still had bones

1,4,713,"00:44:09,285","00:44:13,222","and they will call you

1,4,725,"00:44:50,260","00:44:51,894","No.
"
1,4,726,"00:44:51,928","00:44:54,830","But the common people
are waiting for him.
"
1,4,727,"00:44:54,865","00:44:59,201","Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

1,4,728,"00:44:59,235","00:45:03,371","The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

Ser Jorah?
"
1,4,731,"00:45:13,814","00:45:16,783","Home.
"
1,4,732,"00:45:16,817","00:45:18,985","I pray for home too.

"
1,4,738,"00:45:59,929","00:46:03,032","Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He's known--

1,4,739,"00:46:03,067","00:46:04,567","an old friend
of the family.
"

- Arya!
"
1,4,742,"00:46:10,175","00:46:13,143","- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

1,4,743,"00:46:13,178","00:46:16,813","When I was a child
I was very small
"

called The Fingers,
"
1,4,745,"00:46:19,750","00:46:21,518","so you see,
"
1,4,746,"00:46:21,552","00:46:23,619","it's an exceedingly
clever nickname.

1,4,747,"00:46:23,654","00:46:26,188","I've been sitting here
for days!

"
1,4,757,"00:46:57,255","00:46:59,489","Yes yes, enough
of the bloody pomp.
"
1,4,758,"00:46:59,524","00:47:00,990","Have at it!
"
1,4,759,"00:48:21,009","00:48:24,045","Not what you
were expecting?
"
1,4,760,"00:48:26,883","00:48:30,652","Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?
"
1,4,761,"00:48:31,855","00:48:34,290","Lovely little tale
of brotherly love.
"
1,4,762,"00:48:35,725","00:48:38,594","The Hound was just a pup,
"
1,4,763,"00:48:38,628","00:48:41,029","six years old maybe.
"
1,4,764,"00:48:41,063","00:48:43,265","Gregor a few years older--

1,4,766,"00:48:46,769","00:48:49,204","Some lucky boys
"
1,4,767,"00:48:49,238","00:48:52,407","<i>just born with a talent</i>

"
1,4,768,"00:48:53,776","00:48:57,079","<i>One evening Gregor found</i>

1,4,772,"00:49:04,454","00:49:06,922","Gregor never said a word,
"
1,4,773,"00:49:06,957","00:49:09,725","he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck
"
1,4,774,"00:49:09,760","00:49:12,962","<i>and shoved his face</i>
<i>into the burning coals.</i>

I promise.

1,4,780,"00:49:29,279","00:49:31,180","No, please don't.
"
1,4,781,"00:49:31,215","00:49:33,649","If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,
"
1,4,782,"00:49:33,683","00:49:36,685","I'm afraid all the knights
in King's Landing
"

her Grace the Queen.
"
1,4,785,"00:49:57,870","00:50:00,472","- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.
"
1,4,786,"00:50:00,506","00:50:03,074","Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.
"
1,4,787,"00:50:05,111","00:50:08,313","I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us--
"
1,4,788,"00:50:08,347","00:50:10,582","the ugliness
with the wolves.
"
1,4,789,"00:50:12,752","00:50:15,354","And forcing you to kill
the beast was extreme.
"
1,4,790,"00:50:16,990","00:50:20,093","Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.
"
1,4,791,"00:50:21,528","00:50:23,329","How is Sansa?
"
1,4,792,"00:50:23,364","00:50:25,265","She likes it here.

1,4,794,"00:50:27,068","00:50:29,569","Favors her mother,
"
1,4,795,"00:50:29,603","00:50:31,371","not much
of the North in her.
"
1,4,796,"00:50:31,405","00:50:34,808","- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.
"
1,4,797,"00:50:34,842","00:50:37,010","What is it you
hope to accomplish?
"
1,4,798,"00:50:37,044","00:50:40,113","The King called on me
to serve him and the realm,
"
1,4,799,"00:50:40,148","00:50:42,882","and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.
"
1,4,800,"00:50:42,917","00:50:45,384","You can't change him.
You can't help him.
"
1,4,801,"00:50:45,419","00:50:47,987","He'll do what he wants, which is
all he's ever done.
"
1,4,802,"00:50:48,021","00:50:50,989","You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

then so be it.
"
1,4,804,"00:50:55,261","00:50:57,697","You're just a soldier,
aren't you?
"
1,4,805,"00:50:57,731","00:51:00,466","You take your orders
and you carry on.
"
1,4,806,"00:51:01,502","00:51:03,669","I suppose it makes sense.
"
1,4,807,"00:51:03,704","00:51:07,040","Your older brother was trained to
lead and you were trained to follow.
"
1,4,808,"00:51:07,074","00:51:10,042","I was also trained to kill
my enemies, your Grace.
"
1,4,809,"00:51:13,481","00:51:15,582","As was I.
"
1,4,810,"00:51:33,466","00:51:35,434","Seven blessings to you,
goodfolk!
"
1,4,811,"00:51:35,468","00:51:37,803","And to you.
"
1,4,812,"00:51:37,837","00:51:39,804","Boy!
Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.
"
1,4,813,"00:51:39,839","00:51:42,240","Ah, good idea, grandfather.
I'm starving.
"
1,4,814,"00:51:42,274","00:51:44,075","A song
while we wait or--?
"
1,4,815,"00:51:44,109","00:51:45,910","I'd rather throw myself
down a well.
"
1,4,816,"00:51:45,944","00:51:49,580","Now now, grandfather, this may be your
last chance if you're heading North.
"
1,4,817,"00:51:49,615","00:51:52,617","The only music the Northerners know is
the howling of wolves!
"
1,4,818,"00:51:54,720","00:51:56,387","Gods.
"
1,4,819,"00:51:56,421","00:51:57,922","I'm sorry, My Lord.
We're full up.
"
1,4,820,"00:51:57,956","00:52:00,958","- <i>Every room.</i>
- Tyrion: <i>My men can sleep in the stable.</i>
"
1,4,821,"00:52:00,993","00:52:03,628","As for myself, I don't
require a large room.
"
1,4,822,"00:52:03,662","00:52:06,831","Truly, My Lord,
we have nothing.
"
1,4,823,"00:52:06,865","00:52:09,200","Is there nothing I can do...
"
1,4,824,"00:52:09,234","00:52:11,803","...To remedy this?
"
1,4,825,"00:52:11,837","00:52:13,705","You can have my room.
"
1,4,826,"00:52:13,739","00:52:15,273","Now there's
a clever man.
"
1,4,827,"00:52:17,176","00:52:19,911","You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.
"
1,4,828,"00:52:19,945","00:52:22,047","- Aye, My Lord.
- My Lord of Lannister!
"
1,4,829,"00:52:22,081","00:52:24,182","Might I entertain you
while you eat?
"
1,4,830,"00:52:24,216","00:52:27,118","I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!
"
1,4,831,"00:52:27,152","00:52:29,786","Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

"
1,5,333,"00:23:15,592","00:23:18,894","Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?
"
1,5,334,"00:23:18,929","00:23:22,131","All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.
"
1,5,335,"00:23:22,166","00:23:25,735","And I heard the most awful
rumor about a certain lord
"
1,5,336,"00:23:25,770","00:23:27,771","with a taste
for fresh cadavers.
"
1,5,337,"00:23:27,806","00:23:32,176","Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.
"
1,5,338,"00:23:32,210","00:23:34,111","The logistics alone--
"
1,5,339,"00:23:34,145","00:23:37,514","to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.
"
1,5,340,"00:23:37,549","00:23:39,517","Strictly speaking,
such a thing
"
1,5,341,"00:23:39,551","00:23:41,819","would not be in accordance
with the King's laws.
"
1,5,342,"00:23:41,853","00:23:44,421","Strictly speaking.
"
1,5,343,"00:23:46,992","00:23:49,526","Tell me--
does someone somewhere
"
1,5,344,"00:23:49,561","00:23:53,096","keep your balls
in a little box?
"
1,5,345,"00:23:53,131","00:23:55,565","I've often wondered.
"
1,5,346,"00:23:56,901","00:23:58,802","Do you know I have no idea
where they are?
"
1,5,347,"00:23:58,836","00:24:01,972","And we had been so close.
"
1,5,348,"00:24:02,006","00:24:04,474","But enough about me.
How have you been
"
1,5,349,"00:24:04,508","00:24:06,476","since we last
saw each other?
"
1,5,350,"00:24:06,510","00:24:09,279","Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?
"
1,5,351,"00:24:09,313","00:24:10,852","Now the last time
I saw you,
"
1,5,352,"00:24:10,877","00:24:12,502","you were talking
to the Hand of the King.
"
1,5,353,"00:24:12,683","00:24:15,718","- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.
"
1,5,354,"00:24:15,752","00:24:17,285","Council business.
"
1,5,355,"00:24:17,319","00:24:20,388","We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.
"
1,5,356,"00:24:20,422","00:24:23,424","Everyone's well aware
of your enduring fondness
"
1,5,357,"00:24:23,458","00:24:25,359","for Lord Stark's wife.
"
1,5,358,"00:24:25,393","00:24:29,363","If the Lannisters were behind
the attempt on the Stark boy's life
"
1,5,359,"00:24:29,397","00:24:31,412","and it was discovered
that you helped
"
1,5,360,"00:24:31,437","00:24:33,557","the Starks come
to that conclusion...
"
1,5,361,"00:24:35,237","00:24:38,406","To think a simple word
to the Queen--
"
1,5,362,"00:24:38,441","00:24:40,943","- one shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.
"
1,5,363,"00:24:40,978","00:24:43,613","But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen <i>you</i>
"
1,5,364,"00:24:43,647","00:24:45,515","even more recently
than you have seen me.
"
1,5,365,"00:24:45,549","00:24:48,452","- Have you?
- Yes.
"
1,5,366,"00:24:48,486","00:24:50,287","Earlier today,
I distinctly recall
"
1,5,367,"00:24:50,322","00:24:52,723","seeing you talking to Lord Stark
in his chambers.
"
1,5,368,"00:24:52,757","00:24:54,959","Was that you
under the bed?
"
1,5,369,"00:24:54,993","00:24:56,861","And not long after that
"
1,5,370,"00:24:56,895","00:24:59,864","when I saw you
escorting a certain
"
1,5,371,"00:24:59,898","00:25:02,566","<i>foreign</i> dignitary...
"
1,5,372,"00:25:02,600","00:25:05,202","Council business?
"
1,5,373,"00:25:05,237","00:25:08,806","Of course you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.
"
1,5,374,"00:25:08,840","00:25:11,342","You're from there
yourself, after all.
"
1,5,375,"00:25:11,376","00:25:14,712","We're friends,
aren't we, Lord Varys?
"
1,5,376,"00:25:14,747","00:25:16,915","I'd like to think we are.
"
1,5,377,"00:25:16,949","00:25:19,318","So you can imagine
my burden,
"
1,5,378,"00:25:19,352","00:25:23,222","wondering if the King might
question my friend's sympathies.
"
1,5,379,"00:25:23,256","00:25:27,293","To stand at a crossroads where
turning left means loyalty to a friend,
"
1,5,380,"00:25:27,327","00:25:29,194","turning right
loyalty to the realm--
"
1,5,381,"00:25:29,229","00:25:31,363","- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position
"
1,5,382,"00:25:31,397","00:25:33,665","where a simple word to the King--
"
1,5,383,"00:25:33,699","00:25:35,734","What are you two
conspiring about?
"
1,5,384,"00:25:35,768","00:25:39,338","Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.
"
1,5,385,"00:25:39,373","00:25:40,906","My brother is coming.
"
1,5,386,"00:25:40,941","00:25:42,608","To a small council meeting?
"
1,5,387,"00:25:42,642","00:25:45,644","Disturbing news
from far away.
"
1,5,388,"00:25:46,646","00:25:48,280","Haven't you heard?
"
1,5,389,"00:26:18,147","00:26:20,215","Off with you.
No begging.
"
1,5,390,"00:26:20,250","00:26:22,051","I'm not a beggar.
I live here.
"
1,5,391,"00:26:22,085","00:26:24,487","D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?
"
1,5,392,"00:26:24,521","00:26:26,422","I want to see my father.
"
1,5,393,"00:26:26,457","00:26:29,191","I want to fuck the Queen,
for all the good it does me.
"
1,5,394,"00:26:29,226","00:26:31,059","You want your father, boy?
"
1,5,395,"00:26:31,094","00:26:33,261","He's lying on the floor
of some tavern,
"
1,5,396,"00:26:33,296","00:26:35,363","getting pissed on
by his friends.
"
1,5,397,"00:26:35,397","00:26:37,098","My father
is Hand of the King!
"
1,5,398,"00:26:37,133","00:26:40,435","I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell
"
1,5,399,"00:26:40,469","00:26:42,064","and if you lay a hand on me,
my father
"
1,5,400,"00:26:42,089","00:26:43,628","will have both
your heads on spikes.
"
1,5,401,"00:26:44,006","00:26:46,474","Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you
"
1,5,402,"00:26:46,508","00:26:48,976","on the ear to help
with your hearing?
"
1,5,403,"00:26:51,113","00:26:54,349","You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?
"
1,5,404,"00:26:57,554","00:26:59,321","You promised me
this would stop.
"
1,5,405,"00:26:59,356","00:27:00,990","They said they were
going to kill you.
"
1,5,406,"00:27:01,025","00:27:03,493","- Who did?
- I didn't see them,
"
1,5,407,"00:27:03,528","00:27:05,796","- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.
"
1,5,408,"00:27:05,831","00:27:08,566","I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard
"
1,5,409,"00:27:08,600","00:27:11,569","and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage--
"
1,5,410,"00:27:11,603","00:27:13,270","something about the savage.
"
1,5,411,"00:27:13,305","00:27:15,672","- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,
"
1,5,412,"00:27:15,706","00:27:17,111","near the dragon skulls.
"
1,5,413,"00:27:17,136","00:27:18,471","What were you doing
in the dungeons?
"
1,5,414,"00:27:20,211","00:27:22,312","Chasing a cat.
"
1,5,415,"00:27:24,749","00:27:26,082","Pardon, My Lord.
"
1,5,416,"00:27:26,117","00:27:28,251","<i>There's a night's watchman</i>
<i>here begging a word.</i>
"
1,5,417,"00:27:28,285","00:27:29,585","<i>He says it's urgent.</i>
"
1,5,418,"00:27:36,526","00:27:40,462","- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.
"
1,5,419,"00:27:40,496","00:27:42,339","This must be your son.
He has the look.
"
1,5,420,"00:27:42,364","00:27:43,464","I'm a girl!
"
1,5,421,"00:27:43,482","00:27:44,949","Did Benjen send you?
"
1,5,422,"00:27:44,966","00:27:46,800","No one sent me,
My Lord.
"
1,5,423,"00:27:46,834","00:27:49,069","I'm here to find
men for the Wall,
"
1,5,424,"00:27:49,103","00:27:50,865","see if there's any scum
in the dungeons
"
1,5,425,"00:27:50,890","00:27:52,090","that might be fit for service.
"
1,5,426,"00:27:52,174","00:27:54,408","Oh, we'll find
recruits for you.
"
1,5,427,"00:27:54,442","00:27:55,909","Thank you, My Lord.
"
1,5,428,"00:27:55,944","00:27:58,412","But that's not why
I disturb you now.
"
1,5,429,"00:27:59,648","00:28:02,350","Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black--
"
1,5,430,"00:28:02,384","00:28:04,452","makes him as much
my brother as yours.
"
1,5,431,"00:28:04,486","00:28:07,422","It's for his sake
I rode here so hard
"
1,5,432,"00:28:07,456","00:28:10,058","<i>I damn near</i>
<i>killed my horse.</i>
"
1,5,433,"00:28:10,092","00:28:11,793","There are others
riding too.
"
1,5,434,"00:28:11,827","00:28:13,896","The whole city
will know by tomorrow.
"
1,5,435,"00:28:13,930","00:28:15,631","Know what?
"
1,5,436,"00:28:17,134","00:28:19,769","Best said
in private, My Lord.
"
1,5,437,"00:28:25,010","00:28:28,280","Go on.
We'll talk more later.
"
1,5,438,"00:28:28,314","00:28:30,915","Jory, take her
safely to her room.
"
1,5,439,"00:28:30,950","00:28:34,085","Come along, My Lady.
You heard your father.
"
1,5,440,"00:28:39,591","00:28:41,525","How many guards
does my father have?
"
1,5,441,"00:28:41,560","00:28:43,761","Here in
King's Landing? 50.
"
1,5,442,"00:28:44,997","00:28:47,164","You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?
"
1,5,443,"00:28:47,199","00:28:50,434","No fear on that count,
little lady.
"
1,5,444,"00:28:54,806","00:28:58,075","- Well?
- It's about your wife, My Lord.
"
1,5,445,"00:28:59,678","00:29:01,512","She's taken the Imp.
"
1,5,446,"00:29:18,563","00:29:20,597","You're far from home,
Lady Stark.
"
1,5,447,"00:29:20,631","00:29:22,365","To whom do I speak?
"
1,5,448,"00:29:22,400","00:29:24,401","Ser Vardis Egan,
knight of the Vale.
"
1,5,449,"00:29:24,435","00:29:26,403","Is Lady Arryn
expecting your visit?
"
1,5,450,"00:29:26,437","00:29:28,705","There was no time
to send word.
"
1,5,451,"00:29:28,739","00:29:30,940","May I ask, My Lady,
"
1,5,452,"00:29:30,975","00:29:33,676","why <i>he</i> is with you?
"
1,5,453,"00:29:33,711","00:29:35,745","That's why
there was no time.
"
1,5,454,"00:29:35,779","00:29:38,681","- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.
"
1,5,455,"00:29:38,715","00:29:42,018","My <i>sister</i> will decide
what he looks like.
"
1,5,456,"00:29:42,052","00:29:44,187","Yes, My Lady.
"
1,5,457,"00:29:44,221","00:29:46,423","She will at that.
"
1,5,458,"00:29:52,296","00:29:55,898","The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.
"
1,5,459,"00:29:57,200","00:29:59,234","Give me 10 good men
and some climbing spikes--
"
1,5,460,"00:29:59,269","00:30:01,136","I'll impregnate the bitch.
"
1,5,461,"00:30:02,605","00:30:04,739","I like you.
"
1,5,462,"00:30:14,282","00:30:16,516","Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested
"
1,5,463,"00:30:16,551","00:30:18,918","in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.
"
1,5,464,"00:30:18,953","00:30:21,120","I need to see
the King first-- alone.
"
1,5,465,"00:30:21,154","00:30:23,589","The King is at the small council
meeting, My Lord.
"
1,5,466,"00:30:23,623","00:30:25,357","He has summoned you.
"
1,5,467,"00:30:25,391","00:30:28,561","- Is it about my wife?
- No, My Lord.
"
1,5,468,"00:30:28,595","00:30:31,531","I believe it concerns
Daenerys Targaryen.
"
1,5,469,"00:30:31,565","00:30:33,933","The whore is pregnant.
"
1,5,470,"00:30:33,968","00:30:36,903","- You're speaking of murdering a child.
- I warned you
"
1,5,471,"00:30:36,938","00:30:39,406","this would happen.
Back in the North, I warned you,
"
1,5,472,"00:30:39,441","00:30:41,042","but you didn't care
to hear.
"
1,5,473,"00:30:41,076","00:30:43,679","Well, hear it now.
"
1,5,474,"00:30:43,713","00:30:46,983","I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

1,5,475,"00:30:47,017","00:30:49,152","<i>And that fool Viserys</i>
<i>as well.</i>
"
1,5,476,"00:30:49,186","00:30:51,220","Is that plain enough
for you?

1,5,477,"00:30:51,254","00:30:52,855","<i>I want them both dead.</i>
"
1,5,478,"00:30:52,889","00:30:55,424","You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.
"
1,5,479,"00:30:55,459","00:30:56,459","Honor?!
"
1,5,480,"00:30:56,493","00:30:59,161","I've got Seven Kingdoms
to rule!
"
1,5,481,"00:30:59,196","00:31:01,964","One King,
Seven Kingdoms.
"
1,5,482,"00:31:01,998","00:31:04,433","Do you think honor
keeps them in line?
"
1,5,483,"00:31:04,467","00:31:06,902","Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?
"
1,5,484,"00:31:06,937","00:31:09,538","It's fear--
fear and blood.
"
1,5,485,"00:31:09,572","00:31:11,272","Then we're no better
than the Mad King.
"
1,5,486,"00:31:11,307","00:31:13,308","Careful, Ned.
Careful now.
"
1,5,487,"00:31:13,342","00:31:15,310","You want
to assassinate a girl
"
1,5,488,"00:31:15,344","00:31:17,378","because the Spider
heard a rumor?
"
1,5,489,"00:31:17,413","00:31:20,315","No rumor, My Lord.
The princess is with child.

1,5,490,"00:31:20,349","00:31:22,116","Based on whose

same enthusiasm for his wife.
"
1,5,651,"00:39:38,383","00:39:41,085","He does have a deep, abiding
lust for her money.
"
1,5,652,"00:39:41,120","00:39:43,254","You have to give it
to the Lannisters--
"
1,5,653,"00:39:43,288","00:39:45,189","they may be the most
pompous, ponderous cunts
"
1,5,654,"00:39:45,223","00:39:46,891","the gods ever suffered
to walk the world,
"
1,5,655,"00:39:46,925","00:39:49,593","but they do have outrageous
amounts of money.
"
1,5,656,"00:39:50,829","00:39:52,997","I have an outrageous
amount of money.
"
1,5,657,"00:39:53,031","00:39:54,998","Not as much
as the Lannisters.
"
1,5,658,"00:39:55,032","00:39:57,300","But a lot more than you.
"
1,5,659,"00:39:58,602","00:40:01,303","Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.
"
1,5,660,"00:40:01,338","00:40:03,672","Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

in the rain, day after day,
"
1,5,662,"00:40:06,308","00:40:09,777","all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.
"
1,5,663,"00:40:09,812","00:40:12,781","Oh. But Robert
loves his killing.
"
1,5,664,"00:40:12,815","00:40:15,217","- And he's the King.
- Hmm.
"
1,5,665,"00:40:15,251","00:40:18,554","- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.
"
1,5,666,"00:40:18,588","00:40:20,890","And he used to be
good at it.
"
1,5,667,"00:40:20,924","00:40:23,893","Do you know
who should be king?
"
1,5,668,"00:40:24,862","00:40:26,763","- Be serious.
- I am.
"
1,5,669,"00:40:26,798","00:40:29,099","My father could be
your bank.

1,5,670,"00:40:29,133","00:40:32,001","I've never fought in a war before,

"
1,5,672,"00:40:33,971","00:40:36,772","And where was Robert in the line
of royal succession?

1,5,673,"00:40:36,807","00:40:38,272","Joffrey is a monster.
"
1,5,674,"00:40:38,297","00:40:40,008","- Tommen is eight.

"
1,5,678,"00:40:46,515","00:40:47,629","You cut me.
"
1,5,679,"00:40:47,654","00:40:49,058","It's just blood.
We've all got it in us.
"
1,5,680,"00:40:49,184","00:40:51,452","Sometimes a little spills.
"
1,5,681,"00:40:51,486","00:40:54,889","If you become King, you're
going to see a lot of this.
"
1,5,682,"00:40:54,923","00:40:56,724","You need to get used to it.
"
1,5,683,"00:40:56,758","00:40:58,892","Go on. Look.
"
1,5,684,"00:41:01,263","00:41:03,497","People love you.
"
1,5,685,"00:41:04,799","00:41:06,834","They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.
"
1,5,686,"00:41:06,869","00:41:09,036","They want to be near you.
"
1,5,687,"00:41:11,440","00:41:14,709","You're willing to do
what needs to be done,
"
1,5,688,"00:41:14,743","00:41:17,478","but you don't gloat over it.
"
1,5,689,"00:41:17,513","00:41:19,747","You don't love killing.
"
1,5,690,"00:41:22,284","00:41:24,585","Where is it written
that power
"
1,5,691,"00:41:24,619","00:41:27,387","is the sole province
of the worst?
"
1,5,692,"00:41:27,421","00:41:29,489","That thrones are only made

and the feared?
"
1,5,694,"00:41:35,329","00:41:37,998","You would be
a wonderful King.
"
1,5,695,"00:41:55,218","00:41:58,454","I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

to your brother Jaime.
"
1,5,701,"00:42:14,972","00:42:16,606","No.
"

"
1,5,703,"00:42:18,775","00:42:20,710","I'll say this for Ned Stark:
"
1,5,704,"00:42:20,744","00:42:22,845","He's serious enough.
"
1,5,705,"00:42:24,081","00:42:26,882","Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?
"
1,5,706,"00:42:26,917","00:42:29,018","I don't know.
"
1,5,707,"00:42:31,655","00:42:34,224","But I do know this:
"
1,5,708,"00:42:34,258","00:42:39,328","If the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade
"
1,5,709,"00:42:39,363","00:42:43,566","and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

They don't have armor.
"
1,5,713,"00:42:52,642","00:42:54,610","They don't have
siege weapons.
"
1,5,714,"00:42:54,644","00:42:56,478","It's a neat
little trick you do:
"
1,5,715,"00:42:56,513","00:42:59,782","You move your lips and
your father's voice comes out.
"
1,5,716,"00:42:59,816","00:43:02,951","Is my father wrong?

that Viserys Targaryen

1,5,760,"00:45:38,280","00:45:40,414","Yes, it is.

1,5,761,"00:45:41,550","00:45:43,417","Yes, it is.
"
1,5,762,"00:45:48,523","00:45:50,624","What was she like?

1,5,763,"00:45:52,960","00:45:55,428","You've never asked
about her, not once.
"
1,5,764,"00:45:55,463","00:45:57,831","Why not?
"
1,5,765,"00:45:57,865","00:46:01,201","At first, just saying
her name even in private
"
1,5,766,"00:46:01,236","00:46:04,972","felt like I was breathing
life back into her.
"
1,5,767,"00:46:05,006","00:46:07,207","I thought if I didn't
talk about her,
"
1,5,768,"00:46:07,241","00:46:09,676","she'd just
fade away for you.
"
1,5,769,"00:46:09,711","00:46:12,413","When I realized that
wasn't going to happen,
"
1,5,770,"00:46:12,447","00:46:15,149","I refused to ask
out of spite.
"
1,5,771,"00:46:15,183","00:46:17,351","I didn't want to give you
the satisfaction

enough to ask.
"
1,5,773,"00:46:20,690","00:46:24,059","And eventually it became clear that
my spite didn't mean anything to you.

1,5,774,"00:46:24,094","00:46:26,996","As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.
"
1,5,775,"00:46:27,031","00:46:29,232","So why now?

1,5,776,"00:46:30,768","00:46:34,737","What harm could Lyanna Stark's
ghost do to either of us

away from me,

1,9,4,"00:02:10,368","00:02:12,803","Another visit?
"
1,9,5,"00:02:14,171","00:02:16,572","It seems
you're my last friend.
"
1,9,6,"00:02:16,607","00:02:19,375","No no,
many still love you.
"
1,9,7,"00:02:19,409","00:02:22,677","Sansa came to court
this morning
"
1,9,8,"00:02:22,712","00:02:24,846","to plead for your life.
"
1,9,9,"00:02:26,048","00:02:28,649","On her knees,
begging for me, hmmm.
"
1,9,10,"00:02:28,683","00:02:30,651","Did you laugh
with the others?
"
1,9,11,"00:02:30,685","00:02:32,486","You do me wrong, My Lord.
"
1,9,12,"00:02:32,520","00:02:34,721","Your blood is
the last thing I want.
"
1,9,13,"00:02:34,755","00:02:36,556","I don't know
what you want.
"
1,9,14,"00:02:36,590","00:02:38,524","I've given up
trying to guess.
"
1,9,15,"00:02:41,861","00:02:43,996","When I was still a boy--
"
1,9,16,"00:02:44,064","00:02:47,233","before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife--
"
1,9,17,"00:02:47,267","00:02:51,570","I traveled with a group
of actors through the free cities.
"
1,9,18,"00:02:53,140","00:02:56,141","They taught me that
each man has a role to play.
"
1,9,19,"00:02:56,176","00:02:59,077","The same is true
at court.
"
1,9,20,"00:02:59,112","00:03:01,446","I am the master
of whisperers.
"
1,9,21,"00:03:01,480","00:03:05,349","My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.
"
1,9,22,"00:03:05,384","00:03:07,785","I'm a good actor,
My Lord.
"
1,9,23,"00:03:07,819","00:03:11,321","Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?
"
1,9,24,"00:03:11,355","00:03:13,088","I could.
"
1,9,25,"00:03:13,123","00:03:14,756","But will I?
"
1,9,26,"00:03:14,790","00:03:17,424","No.
"
1,9,27,"00:03:17,459","00:03:19,292","As I said,
I'm no hero.
"
1,9,28,"00:03:19,327","00:03:21,360","What do you want?
Tell me.
"
1,9,29,"00:03:21,394","00:03:24,361","No riddles, no stories--
tell me, what do you want?
"
1,9,30,"00:03:25,996","00:03:28,063","Peace.
"
1,9,31,"00:03:28,097","00:03:30,898","Did you know that
your son is marching south
"
1,9,32,"00:03:30,932","00:03:34,000","with an army of Northmen?
Loyal lad--
"
1,9,33,"00:03:34,035","00:03:36,670","fighting for
his father's freedom.
"
1,9,34,"00:03:36,704","00:03:38,938","Robb?
"
1,9,35,"00:03:38,972","00:03:40,972","He's just a boy.
"
1,9,36,"00:03:41,007","00:03:43,441","Boys have been
conquerors before.
"
1,9,37,"00:03:43,475","00:03:45,776","But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights
"
1,9,38,"00:03:45,811","00:03:49,379","is the King's--
the late King's brother.
"
1,9,39,"00:03:49,413","00:03:52,882","Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the Throne,
"
1,9,40,"00:03:52,916","00:03:56,118","he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.
"
1,9,41,"00:03:56,152","00:03:58,286","Stannis Baratheon
is Robert's true heir.
"
1,9,42,"00:03:58,320","00:04:00,588","The Throne
is his by rights.
"
1,9,43,"00:04:00,622","00:04:05,158","Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
so sweetly for your life,
"
1,9,44,"00:04:05,192","00:04:07,427","it would be a shame
to throw it away.
"
1,9,45,"00:04:07,461","00:04:10,196","Cersei is no fool.
"
1,9,46,"00:04:10,231","00:04:14,233","She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.
"
1,9,47,"00:04:14,300","00:04:17,035","You want me to serve the
woman who murdered my King,
"
1,9,48,"00:04:17,069","00:04:19,804","who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?
"
1,9,49,"00:04:19,839","00:04:21,907","I want you
to serve the realm!
"
1,9,50,"00:04:21,941","00:04:24,677","Tell the Queen you will confess
your vile treason,
"
1,9,51,"00:04:24,712","00:04:26,980","tell your son
to lay down his sword
"
1,9,52,"00:04:27,015","00:04:30,284","and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.
"
1,9,53,"00:04:32,187","00:04:35,189","Cersei knows you
as a man of honor.
"
1,9,54,"00:04:35,223","00:04:37,291","If you give her
the peace she needs
"
1,9,55,"00:04:37,326","00:04:40,194","and promise to carry
her secret to your grave,
"
1,9,56,"00:04:40,228","00:04:44,030","I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days
"
1,9,57,"00:04:44,064","00:04:46,498","on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.
"
1,9,58,"00:04:47,834","00:04:50,601","You think my life is
some precious thing to me?
"
1,9,59,"00:04:52,037","00:04:55,439","That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...
"
1,9,60,"00:04:55,474","00:04:57,241","Of what?
"
1,9,61,"00:05:02,079","00:05:04,114","You grew up with actors.
"
1,9,62,"00:05:05,649","00:05:09,418","You learned their craft
and you learned it well.
"
1,9,63,"00:05:09,452","00:05:12,053","But I grew up
with soldiers.
"
1,9,64,"00:05:13,989","00:05:17,224","I learned how to die
a long time ago.
"
1,9,65,"00:05:19,594","00:05:22,028","Pity.
"
1,9,66,"00:05:22,063","00:05:24,330","<i>Such a pity.</i>
"
1,9,67,"00:05:31,003","00:05:33,438","What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?
"
1,9,68,"00:05:33,472","00:05:36,574","<i>Is that a precious</i>
<i>thing to you?</i>
"
1,9,69,"00:06:17,539","00:06:20,340","It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.
"
1,9,70,"00:06:20,375","00:06:22,476","Or so Walder Frey
would have you think.
"
1,9,71,"00:06:22,510","00:06:24,811","Keep shooting them down.
We can't risk Lord Walder
"
1,9,72,"00:06:24,845","00:06:27,446","sending word of your movements
to the Lannisters.
"
1,9,73,"00:06:27,481","00:06:30,482","He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?
"
1,9,74,"00:06:30,517","00:06:34,451","Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.
"
1,9,75,"00:06:34,486","00:06:36,587","Look.
"
1,9,76,"00:06:37,755","00:06:39,656","<i>Father rots</i>
<i>in a dungeon.</i>
"
1,9,77,"00:06:39,690","00:06:41,724","How long before
they take his head?
"
1,9,78,"00:06:41,758","00:06:45,060","We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.
"
1,9,79,"00:06:45,094","00:06:47,495","Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.
"
1,9,80,"00:06:47,530","00:06:50,498","We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.
"
1,9,81,"00:06:50,532","00:06:53,901","Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.
"
1,9,82,"00:06:53,935","00:06:56,669","The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,
"
1,9,83,"00:06:56,703","00:07:00,105","and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.
"
1,9,84,"00:07:00,139","00:07:01,973","Have my horse
saddled and ready.
"
1,9,85,"00:07:02,007","00:07:05,710","Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannis.
"
1,9,86,"00:07:05,744","00:07:08,578","Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.
"
1,9,87,"00:07:11,048","00:07:14,017","My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.
"
1,9,88,"00:07:14,052","00:07:16,253","Whatever it took.
"
1,9,89,"00:07:16,287","00:07:18,188","If I'm going
to lead this army,
"
1,9,90,"00:07:18,223","00:07:20,725","I can't have other men
doing my bargaining for me.
"
1,9,91,"00:07:20,759","00:07:23,295","I agree.
"
1,9,92,"00:07:24,330","00:07:25,864","- I'll go.
- Theon: <i>You can't!</i>
"
1,9,93,"00:07:25,898","00:07:28,499","I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.
"
1,9,94,"00:07:28,533","00:07:30,167","He would never
harm me.
"
1,9,95,"00:07:30,202","00:07:32,836","<i>Unless there was</i>
<i>a profit in it.</i>
"
1,9,96,"00:07:38,442","00:07:40,342","What do you want?
"
1,9,97,"00:07:40,377","00:07:44,044","It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.
"
1,9,98,"00:07:44,079","00:07:45,879","Oh spare me.
"
1,9,99,"00:07:45,913","00:07:48,882","Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.
"
1,9,100,"00:07:48,916","00:07:52,184","What am I supposed
to do with you?
"
1,9,101,"00:07:52,219","00:07:55,554","Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here--
"
1,9,102,"00:07:55,588","00:07:59,023","Who asked you?
You're not Lord Frey yet,
"
1,9,103,"00:07:59,058","00:08:01,525","not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?
"
1,9,104,"00:08:01,550","00:08:02,470","Father, please--
"
1,9,105,"00:08:02,495","00:08:05,108","I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?
"
1,9,106,"00:08:05,463","00:08:07,997","Your mother would still
be a milkmaid
"
1,9,107,"00:08:08,032","00:08:10,933","if I hadn't squirted you
into her belly.
"
1,9,108,"00:08:14,504","00:08:17,672","All right,
you come forward.
"
1,9,109,"00:08:29,150","00:08:31,517","There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,
"
1,9,110,"00:08:31,551","00:08:35,220","<i>perhaps my sons will do me the honor</i>
<i>of shutting their mouths.</i>
"
1,9,111,"00:08:40,526","00:08:42,526","Is there somewhere
we can talk?
"
1,9,112,"00:08:42,560","00:08:45,462","We're talking
right now.
"
1,9,113,"00:08:48,732","00:08:50,266","Fine.
"
1,9,114,"00:08:50,300","00:08:52,934","Out! All of you!
"
1,9,115,"00:09:02,912","00:09:04,779","You too.
"
1,9,116,"00:09:11,987","00:09:14,154","You see that?
"
1,9,117,"00:09:14,189","00:09:15,789","15 she is.
"
1,9,118,"00:09:15,824","00:09:18,258","A little flower.
"
1,9,119,"00:09:19,894","00:09:22,795","And her honey's all mine.
"
1,9,120,"00:09:24,831","00:09:27,333","I'm sure she will
give you many sons.
"
1,9,121,"00:09:27,367","00:09:31,103","Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.
"
1,9,122,"00:09:31,137","00:09:33,472","He is quite ill, My Lord.
"
1,9,123,"00:09:33,506","00:09:36,408","Didn't come to
the last one either.
"
1,9,124,"00:09:36,443","00:09:38,911","Or the one before that.
"
1,9,125,"00:09:40,447","00:09:42,514","Your family has always
pissed on me.
"
1,9,126,"00:09:42,548","00:09:45,349","- My Lord, I--
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.
"
1,9,127,"00:09:45,384","00:09:47,752","The fine Lord Tully
"
1,9,128,"00:09:47,786","00:09:50,053","would never marry any
of his children to mine.
"
1,9,129,"00:09:50,087","00:09:52,021","I'm sure there
were reasons why--
"
1,9,130,"00:09:52,055","00:09:54,690","I didn't need reasons.
I needed to get rid
"
1,9,131,"00:09:54,724","00:09:58,260","of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?
"
1,9,132,"00:10:01,697","00:10:04,431","Why are you here?
"
1,9,133,"00:10:04,466","00:10:07,099","To ask you
"
1,9,134,"00:10:07,134","00:10:09,434","to open your gates,
My Lord,
"
1,9,135,"00:10:09,469","00:10:13,949","so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.
"
1,9,136,"00:10:13,950","00:10:15,183","Why should I let him?
"
1,9,137,"00:10:15,208","00:10:17,157","If you could climb
your own battlements,
"
1,9,138,"00:10:17,509","00:10:21,011","you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.
"
1,9,139,"00:10:21,045","00:10:24,447","They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.
"
1,9,140,"00:10:24,482","00:10:26,949","Don't try and frighten me,
Lady Stark.
"
1,9,141,"00:10:26,984","00:10:29,518","Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep
"
1,9,142,"00:10:29,553","00:10:32,454","and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.
"
1,9,143,"00:10:32,488","00:10:34,923","You swore an oath
to my father.
"
1,9,144,"00:10:34,957","00:10:37,225","Oh yes, I said some words...
"
1,9,145,"00:10:37,259","00:10:41,094","And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.
"
1,9,146,"00:10:41,129","00:10:44,930","Joffrey's King now,
which makes your boy
"
1,9,147,"00:10:44,965","00:10:48,500","and his corpses-to-be nothing
but rebels, it seems to me.
"
1,9,148,"00:10:50,002","00:10:52,369","If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,
"
1,9,149,"00:10:52,403","00:10:54,438","I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.
"
1,9,150,"00:10:54,472","00:10:57,007","- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,
"
1,9,151,"00:10:57,041","00:10:59,309","Lannister, Baratheon,
"
1,9,152,"00:10:59,377","00:11:02,011","give me one good reason
"
1,9,153,"00:11:02,046","00:11:05,481","why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?
"
1,9,154,"00:11:05,515","00:11:08,851","<i>And... engage.
"
1,9,155,"00:11:10,051","00:11:12,384","When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?
"
1,9,156,"00:11:12,656","00:11:15,490","- Soon, he says.
- Good.
"
1,9,157,"00:11:15,525","00:11:19,494","You'll be ready
for this then.
"
1,9,158,"00:11:19,529","00:11:22,764","I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you
"
1,9,159,"00:11:22,798","00:11:24,866","than a bear...
"
1,9,160,"00:11:24,901","00:11:28,870","So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.
"
1,9,161,"00:11:28,904","00:11:32,739","Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

1,9,488,"00:36:18,812","00:36:20,979","She swung
an axe at me.
"
1,9,489,"00:36:22,581","00:36:24,315","You've been
North of the Wall.
"
1,9,490,"00:36:27,352","00:36:29,453","What brought you
up there?
"
1,9,491,"00:36:30,622","00:36:31,756","Work.
"
1,9,492,"00:36:31,824","00:36:33,825","And...
"
1,9,493,"00:36:33,826","00:36:35,894","You once loved a woman
many years ago,
"
1,9,494,"00:36:35,928","00:36:39,197","but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.
"
1,9,495,"00:36:40,999","00:36:43,434","Oh wait, that's me.
"
1,9,496,"00:36:46,638","00:36:49,506","Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.
"
1,9,497,"00:36:49,541","00:36:51,375","I don't want to play.
"
1,9,498,"00:36:51,409","00:36:55,279","It's fun!
Look at the fun we're having.
"
1,9,499,"00:36:58,416","00:36:59,950","Your mother
was a whore.
"
1,9,500,"00:37:01,385","00:37:03,787","Drink.
"
1,9,501,"00:37:09,327","00:37:11,227","All right.
"
1,9,502,"00:37:11,262","00:37:13,997","Your father left the family when
you were very young,
"
1,9,503,"00:37:14,031","00:37:16,032","- never to return.
- Drink.
"
1,9,504,"00:37:17,240","00:37:18,991","And we've established
the rules about lying?
"
1,9,505,"00:37:19,016","00:37:20,216","Drink!
"
1,9,506,"00:37:23,574","00:37:26,142","Mmmm.
"
1,9,507,"00:37:27,544","00:37:29,378","You wanted
a different life.
"
1,9,508,"00:37:29,413","00:37:32,547","You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.
"
1,9,509,"00:37:32,582","00:37:35,150","The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.
"
1,9,510,"00:37:35,184","00:37:37,452","So specifics--
"
1,9,511,"00:37:37,486","00:37:40,689","you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?
"
1,9,512,"00:37:40,723","00:37:44,393","I don't believe the life
of the silent sisters is for you.
"
1,9,513,"00:37:44,427","00:37:48,697","So what's
a lowborn girl to do?
"
1,9,514,"00:37:52,068","00:37:54,302","Drink.
"
1,9,515,"00:37:56,038","00:37:59,007","- Are you sure--
- drink!
"
1,9,516,"00:38:03,546","00:38:07,216","And don't talk about
my mother and father ever
"
1,9,517,"00:38:07,251","00:38:10,688","or I will carve your eyes
from your head.
"
1,9,518,"00:38:14,225","00:38:17,260","My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.
"
1,9,519,"00:38:17,294","00:38:19,461","My turn.
"
1,9,520,"00:38:19,496","00:38:21,897","Fine fine.
"
1,9,521,"00:38:21,931","00:38:24,232","Ask away.
"
1,9,522,"00:38:24,266","00:38:27,335","Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.
"
1,9,523,"00:38:27,369","00:38:30,137","- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.
"
1,9,524,"00:38:30,171","00:38:32,505","I don't care the way
the game works.
"
1,9,525,"00:38:32,540","00:38:34,641","Our Lord here
used to be married.
"
1,9,526,"00:38:35,743","00:38:37,744","- Married?
- How did you hear that?
"
1,9,527,"00:38:37,778","00:38:41,315","You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.
"
1,9,528,"00:38:43,752","00:38:45,053","Another night,
perhaps.
"
1,9,529,"00:38:45,087","00:38:48,390","Not another night.
This night.
"
1,9,530,"00:38:49,827","00:38:51,561","It's not
a pleasant story.
"
1,9,531,"00:38:53,599","00:38:56,736","- Or maybe I will cry.
- I'm guessing the lady and I
"
1,9,532,"00:38:56,770","00:38:59,506","can tell more unpleasant stories
than your Lordship.
"
1,9,533,"00:39:01,906","00:39:04,173","So...
"
1,9,534,"00:39:07,377","00:39:10,980","I was 16. My brother Jaime
and I were riding
"
1,9,535,"00:39:11,014","00:39:14,716","when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road,
"
1,9,536,"00:39:14,750","00:39:17,417","clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.
"
1,9,537,"00:39:17,452","00:39:21,987","Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.
"
1,9,538,"00:39:22,021","00:39:24,076","She was too scared to send off
on her own,
"
1,9,539,"00:39:24,101","00:39:25,948","so while Jaime
hunted down the rapers
"
1,9,540,"00:39:25,992","00:39:29,127","I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.
"
1,9,541,"00:39:29,161","00:39:31,929","Her name was Tysha.
"
1,9,542,"00:39:31,963","00:39:34,198","She was
a wheelwright's orphan.
"
1,9,543,"00:39:34,232","00:39:36,366","And she was hungry--
"
1,9,544,"00:39:36,401","00:39:39,803","together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.
"
1,9,545,"00:39:39,837","00:39:43,238","Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.
"
1,9,546,"00:39:43,273","00:39:46,107","I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,
"
1,9,547,"00:39:46,142","00:39:49,545","how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me
"
1,9,548,"00:39:49,579","00:39:52,013","or look away embarrassed
"
1,9,549,"00:39:52,048","00:39:54,448","or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.
"
1,9,550,"00:39:54,483","00:39:57,585","I forgot about
everything but Tysha.
"
1,9,551,"00:39:58,853","00:40:01,221","And somehow I found
myself in her bed.
"
1,9,552,"00:40:01,255","00:40:03,690","For three chickens,
I should hope so.
"
1,9,553,"00:40:03,725","00:40:07,594","It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.
"
1,9,554,"00:40:07,629","00:40:10,230","But she was good to me.
"
1,9,555,"00:40:10,265","00:40:12,366","She kissed me afterwards
"
1,9,556,"00:40:12,400","00:40:15,302","and sang me a song.
"
1,9,557,"00:40:15,336","00:40:20,441","And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.
"
1,9,558,"00:40:20,475","00:40:23,177","A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon
"
1,9,559,"00:40:23,211","00:40:25,613","and there you have it--
man and wife.
"
1,9,560,"00:40:25,647","00:40:29,250","For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up
"
1,9,561,"00:40:29,284","00:40:31,318","and told my father.
"
1,9,562,"00:40:31,353","00:40:34,321","I imagine that was
the end of all that.
"
1,9,563,"00:40:34,355","00:40:36,389","Not quite.
"
1,9,564,"00:40:36,424","00:40:40,027","First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.
"
1,9,565,"00:40:41,229","00:40:44,164","The girl was a whore,
you see.
"
1,9,566,"00:40:45,734","00:40:47,668","Jaime had arranged
the whole thing,
"
1,9,567,"00:40:47,702","00:40:50,537","the road, the rapers--
all of it.
"
1,9,568,"00:40:50,572","00:40:53,173","He thought it was time
I had a woman.
"
1,9,569,"00:40:55,143","00:40:57,311","<i>After my brother confessed,</i>
"
1,9,570,"00:40:57,345","00:41:00,647","my father brought in my wife
"
1,9,571,"00:41:00,682","00:41:03,450","and gave her
to his guards.
"
1,9,572,"00:41:03,484","00:41:07,020","<i>He paid her well--</i>
<i>a silver for each man.</i>
"
1,9,573,"00:41:07,054","00:41:10,023","How many whores command
that kind of price?
"
1,9,574,"00:41:11,559","00:41:14,995","He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.
"
1,9,575,"00:41:15,029","00:41:18,431","By the end,
she had so much silver
"
1,9,576,"00:41:18,465","00:41:21,400","that the coins were
slipping through her fingers
"
1,9,577,"00:41:21,435","00:41:24,236","and rolling
onto the floor.
"
1,9,578,"00:41:26,974","00:41:29,976","I would have killed the man
who did that to me.
"
1,9,579,"00:41:30,010","00:41:33,246","You should have known
she was a whore.
"
1,9,580,"00:41:33,280","00:41:35,581","Really?
"
1,9,581,"00:41:35,615","00:41:38,451","I was 16, drunk
and in love--
"
1,9,582,"00:41:38,485","00:41:40,386","A girl who
was almost raped
"
1,9,583,"00:41:40,421","00:41:43,389","doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.
"
1,9,584,"00:41:44,991","00:41:49,294","As I said, I was
young and stupid.
"
1,9,585,"00:41:51,497","00:41:53,932","You are still
young and stupid.
"
1,9,586,"00:42:17,255","00:42:19,456","Hyah!
"
1,9,587,"00:42:35,673","00:42:37,307","What is it?
What do you want?
"
1,9,588,"00:42:37,341","00:42:39,176","You're sleeping
through the war.
"
1,9,589,"00:42:39,210","00:42:42,112","- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.
"
1,9,590,"00:42:42,146","00:42:44,380","They're a mile north.
"
1,9,591,"00:42:44,415","00:42:47,016","- <i>Get my squire!</i>
- You don't have a squire.
"
1,9,592,"00:42:49,386","00:42:51,720","If I die, weep for me.
"
1,9,593,"00:42:52,955","00:42:56,057","You'll be dead.
How will you know?
"
1,9,594,"00:43:02,101","00:43:04,068","I'll know.
"
1,9,595,"00:43:05,904","00:43:07,771","Watch out!
Move!

1,9,596,"00:43:08,807","00:43:10,374","Out of the way!

have his sisters.
"
1,10,243,"00:19:40,631","00:19:43,266","The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.
"
1,10,244,"00:19:43,301","00:19:45,169","No truces.
We can't afford to look weak.

1,10,247,"00:19:49,474","00:19:51,942","They have my son!
"
1,10,248,"00:19:54,579","00:19:56,681","Get out, all of you.
"
1,10,249,"00:20:07,159","00:20:09,394","Not you.
"
1,10,250,"00:20:24,276","00:20:27,179","You were right
about Eddard Stark.
"
1,10,251,"00:20:28,981","00:20:31,015","If he were alive,
we could have used him
"
1,10,252,"00:20:31,049","00:20:34,318","to broker a peace
with Winterfell and Riverrun,
"
1,10,253,"00:20:34,353","00:20:36,687","which would have
given us more time
"
1,10,254,"00:20:36,721","00:20:39,557","to deal with Robert's brothers.
But now...
"
1,10,255,"00:20:40,793","00:20:43,828","Madness--
madness and stupidity.
"
1,10,256,"00:20:46,699","00:20:49,835","I always thought
you were a stunted fool.
"
1,10,257,"00:20:51,505","00:20:53,138","Perhaps I was wrong.
"
1,10,258,"00:20:53,140","00:20:55,442","Half wrong.
"
1,10,259,"00:20:56,877","00:20:59,213","I'm new to strategy, but--

1,10,260,"00:20:59,247","00:21:01,481","unless we want to be

"
1,10,262,"00:21:03,585","00:21:05,485","No one will stay here.
"
1,10,263,"00:21:05,519","00:21:08,954","Ser Gregor will head out
with 500 riders
"
1,10,264,"00:21:08,989","00:21:12,892","and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.
"
1,10,265,"00:21:12,926","00:21:16,395","The rest of us will
regroup at Harrenhal.
"
1,10,266,"00:21:18,498","00:21:20,633","And you will go
to King's Landing.
"
1,10,267,"00:21:20,667","00:21:22,868","And do what?
"
1,10,268,"00:21:22,903","00:21:24,804","Rule!
"
1,10,269,"00:21:24,838","00:21:27,706","You will serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.
"
1,10,270,"00:21:27,740","00:21:31,776","You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.
"
1,10,271,"00:21:31,810","00:21:35,480","And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest:

- Heads, spikes, walls.
"

"
1,10,274,"00:21:41,821","00:21:44,389","Why not anyone?
Why me?
"
1,10,275,"00:21:44,424","00:21:46,992","You're my son.
"
1,10,276,"00:21:54,201","00:21:56,502","Oh, one more thing:
"
1,10,277,"00:21:56,537","00:21:59,939","You will not take
the whore to court.
"
1,10,278,"00:21:59,973","00:22:01,907","Do you understand?
"
1,10,279,"00:22:21,160","00:22:23,795","Ser Jorah?
"
1,10,280,"00:22:27,199","00:22:30,368","Gently gently.
"
1,10,281,"00:22:32,103","00:22:33,837","My son...
"
1,10,282,"00:22:33,871","00:22:36,373","Where is he?
I want him.
"
1,10,283,"00:22:39,009","00:22:40,777","Where is he?
"
1,10,284,"00:22:42,881","00:22:45,115","The boy did not live.
"
1,10,285,"00:22:52,158","00:22:54,926","- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?
"
1,10,286,"00:22:54,961","00:22:57,362","How did my son die?!
"
1,10,287,"00:22:58,798","00:23:01,867","He never lived,
My Princess.
"
1,10,288,"00:23:01,902","00:23:03,969","The women say...
"
1,10,289,"00:23:04,004","00:23:05,771","What do the women say?
"
1,10,290,"00:23:08,341","00:23:11,644","- They say the child was--
- <i>Monstrous,</i>
"
1,10,291,"00:23:11,678","00:23:13,312","twisted.
"
1,10,292,"00:23:13,346","00:23:15,347","I pulled him out
myself.
"
1,10,293,"00:23:16,783","00:23:19,251","He was scaled
like a lizard,
"
1,10,294,"00:23:19,285","00:23:23,655","<i>blind, with leather wings</i>
<i>like the wings of a bat.</i>
"
1,10,295,"00:23:23,690","00:23:26,925","When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.
"
1,10,296,"00:23:26,959","00:23:30,896","Inside he was
full of graveworms.
"
1,10,297,"00:23:33,166","00:23:37,670","I warned you that only death
can pay for life.
"
1,10,298,"00:23:37,704","00:23:39,839","You knew the price.
"
1,10,299,"00:23:39,873","00:23:42,809","Where is Khal Drogo?
"
1,10,300,"00:23:42,843","00:23:44,944","Show him to me.
"
1,10,301,"00:23:44,978","00:23:47,513","Show me what I bought

1,10,302,"00:23:47,547","00:23:50,449","with my son's life.
"
1,10,303,"00:23:50,483","00:23:52,551","As you command, lady.
"
1,10,304,"00:23:52,585","00:23:54,252","Come.
"
1,10,305,"00:23:54,286","00:23:56,087","I will take you
to him.
"
1,10,306,"00:23:56,121","00:23:59,056","- Time enough for that later--
- I want to see him now.
"
1,10,307,"00:24:14,775","00:24:17,010","The Khalasar is gone.
"
1,10,308,"00:24:17,044","00:24:19,646","A Khal who cannot ride
is no Khal.

1,10,309,"00:24:19,681","00:24:22,516","The Dothraki

"
1,10,310,"00:24:22,550","00:24:25,218","I'm sorry, My Princess.

1,10,311,"00:24:37,065","00:24:38,165","Drogo!
"
1,10,312,"00:24:42,303","00:24:44,204","Why is he out here alone?
"
1,10,313,"00:24:44,239","00:24:47,007","He seems to like
the warmth, Princess.
"
1,10,314,"00:24:51,246","00:24:52,980","<i>He lives.</i>
"
1,10,315,"00:24:53,014","00:24:55,816","<i>You asked for life,</i>

"
1,10,316,"00:24:55,850","00:24:59,452","This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

1,10,317,"00:24:59,487","00:25:01,855","When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east
"
1,10,318,"00:25:01,890","00:25:03,924","<i>when the seas go dry.</i>
"
1,10,319,"00:25:03,958","00:25:07,728","When the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.
"
1,10,320,"00:25:22,879","00:25:24,580","Leave us.
"
1,10,321,"00:25:26,082","00:25:28,317","I don't want you alone
with this sorceress.
"
1,10,322,"00:25:28,352","00:25:31,554","I have nothing more
to fear from this woman.
"
1,10,323,"00:25:32,456","00:25:34,056","Go.
"
1,10,324,"00:25:39,896","00:25:43,232","You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.
"
1,10,325,"00:25:43,266","00:25:46,134","It was wrong of them
to burn my temple.
"
1,10,326,"00:25:46,169","00:25:50,105","- <i>It angered the Great Shepherd.</i>
- This is not God's work.
"
1,10,327,"00:25:50,139","00:25:52,774","- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?
"
1,10,328,"00:25:52,808","00:25:56,077","He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.
"
1,10,329,"00:25:56,111","00:25:57,556","Now he will burn no cities.
"
1,10,330,"00:25:57,581","00:26:00,132","Now his Khalasar will trample
no nations into dust.
"
1,10,331,"00:26:00,516","00:26:02,851","I spoke for you.
"
1,10,332,"00:26:02,885","00:26:05,087","I saved you.
"
1,10,333,"00:26:05,121","00:26:07,722","Saved me?
"
1,10,334,"00:26:07,756","00:26:09,857","Three of those riders
had already
"
1,10,335,"00:26:09,892","00:26:12,627","raped me before
you saved me, girl.
"
1,10,336,"00:26:15,731","00:26:18,333","I saw my God's house burn,
"
1,10,337,"00:26:18,367","00:26:22,737","there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.
"
1,10,338,"00:26:22,771","00:26:25,439","In the streets
I saw piles of heads--
"
1,10,339,"00:26:25,474","00:26:28,009","the head of the Baker
who makes my bread,
"
1,10,340,"00:26:28,043","00:26:29,443","the head of a young boy
"
1,10,341,"00:26:29,478","00:26:32,313","that I had cured of fever
just three moons past.
"
1,10,342,"00:26:32,347","00:26:36,317","So tell me again
exactly what it was
"
1,10,343,"00:26:36,351","00:26:37,719","that you saved.
"
1,10,344,"00:26:37,753","00:26:39,687","Your life.
"
1,10,345,"00:26:39,721","00:26:41,722","Hmph.
"
1,10,346,"00:26:41,757","00:26:44,358","Why don't you take
a look at your Khal...
"
1,10,347,"00:26:46,128","00:26:48,963","Then you will see
exactly what life is worth
"
1,10,348,"00:26:48,997","00:26:51,799","when all the rest has gone.
"
1,10,349,"00:27:04,479","00:27:06,714","You can't!
"
1,10,350,"00:27:06,748","00:27:08,950","Get out of my way, Sam.
"
1,10,351,"00:27:08,984","00:27:11,285","They'll put out the word.
"
1,10,352,"00:27:11,320","00:27:14,222","They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.
"
1,10,353,"00:27:14,256","00:27:17,092","Do you know what happens
to deserters?
"
1,10,354,"00:27:19,995","00:27:21,696","Better than you do.
"
1,10,355,"00:27:21,730","00:27:24,399","What are you going to do?
"
1,10,356,"00:27:24,433","00:27:26,334","I'm gonna find my brother
"
1,10,357,"00:27:26,369","00:27:29,404","and put a sword through
King Joffrey's throat.
"
1,10,358,"00:27:30,573","00:27:33,709","You can't leave us now.
We need you here.
"
1,10,359,"00:27:33,743","00:27:37,746","- Move.
- I won't let you go.
"
1,10,360,"00:27:37,780","00:27:40,682","- Move.
- No.
"
1,10,361,"00:27:41,551","00:27:43,418","Hyah!
"
1,10,362,"00:27:58,270","00:28:01,072","Hand of the King?
"
1,10,363,"00:28:01,106","00:28:03,107","So it would seem.
"
1,10,364,"00:28:03,141","00:28:07,645","And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing.
"
1,10,365,"00:28:07,679","00:28:10,615","No, he said I couldn't take <i>you</i>
with me to King's Landing.
"
1,10,366,"00:28:10,649","00:28:12,317","He was very specific
on that point.
"
1,10,367,"00:28:12,351","00:28:14,352","He knew my name?
"
1,10,368,"00:28:14,386","00:28:16,120","What?
"
1,10,369,"00:28:16,154","00:28:18,722","He said, ""Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing""?
"
1,10,370,"00:28:18,757","00:28:21,858","I believe he used
the word ""whore.""
"
1,10,371,"00:28:23,027","00:28:24,994","Are you ashamed of me?
"
1,10,372,"00:28:25,029","00:28:28,064","Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?
"
1,10,373,"00:28:28,098","00:28:31,200","I'm funny now?
"
1,10,374,"00:28:31,235","00:28:33,436","I'm Shae the funny whore.
"
1,10,375,"00:28:34,905","00:28:37,907","My father's probably the most
powerful man in the country.
"
1,10,376,"00:28:37,941","00:28:39,208","Certainly the richest.
"
1,10,377,"00:28:39,243","00:28:41,844","<i>He has all Seven Kingdoms</i>

"
1,10,378,"00:28:41,878","00:28:43,679","Everyone everywhere
"
1,10,379,"00:28:43,713","00:28:46,849","always has to do exactly
what my father says.
"
1,10,380,"00:28:48,318","00:28:50,286","He's always been a cunt.
"
1,10,381,"00:28:57,228","00:28:58,895","I believe the ladies
of the court
"
1,10,382,"00:28:58,930","00:29:02,032","<i>could learn a great deal</i>
<i>from a girl like you.</i>
"
1,10,383,"00:29:04,269","00:29:06,003","Why don't you
come with me,

1,10,384,"00:29:06,037","00:29:08,772","<i>be the Hand's lady?</i>
"
1,10,385,"00:29:10,308","00:29:12,976","Because the King needs
a Hand and the Hand--
"
1,10,386,"00:29:17,348","00:29:20,084","I know what
a Hand needs.
"
1,10,387,"00:29:33,098","00:29:35,033","- Ghost?

"
1,10,388,"00:29:35,067","00:29:37,936","- Hyah.

1,10,514,"00:39:53,020","00:39:56,256","This lot, half of them would
turn you over to the King

1,10,515,"00:39:56,290","00:39:58,391","quick as spit for a pardon.
"
1,10,516,"00:39:58,425","00:40:00,460","And the other half
would do the same,

rape you first.

1,10,533,"00:40:45,473","00:40:47,573","You'd better give
Hot Pie the sword.

1,10,534,"00:40:47,608","00:40:49,309","I've seen him
kick a boy to death.

1,10,535,"00:40:49,343","00:40:51,711","I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

1,10,536,"00:40:51,745","00:40:54,113","and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.
"
1,10,537,"00:40:54,148","00:40:57,583","I kicked him
all to pieces.

1,10,539,"00:41:00,687","00:41:02,521","I'll give it to you.
"
1,10,540,"00:41:02,556","00:41:05,258","I already killed
one fat boy.

6,2,119,"00:15:10,185","00:15:12,019","But I can't.
"
6,2,120,"00:15:12,104","00:15:13,470","Why not?
"
6,2,121,"00:15:14,890","00:15:18,475","When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,
"
6,2,122,"00:15:18,560","00:15:20,444","what did I do?
"
6,2,123,"00:15:21,981","00:15:25,732","When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,
"
6,2,124,"00:15:25,818","00:15:27,618","what did I do?
"
6,2,125,"00:15:28,737","00:15:31,071","We all fail sometimes.
"
6,2,126,"00:15:31,206","00:15:34,574","The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

6,2,127,"00:15:34,660","00:15:38,128","If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,
"
6,2,128,"00:15:38,247","00:15:39,913","what good am I?
"
6,2,129,"00:15:40,049","00:15:43,083","Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.
"
6,2,130,"00:15:45,554","00:15:47,754","Your Grace.
"
6,2,131,"00:15:47,840","00:15:49,556","Lord Commander.
"
6,2,132,"00:15:49,642","00:15:52,392","I want to see my wife.
"
6,2,133,"00:15:52,478","00:15:54,811","The gods wait for Queen Margaery
"
6,2,134,"00:15:54,930","00:15:58,315","to confess her crimes

"
6,2,135,"00:15:58,434","00:16:01,351","The king must wait as well.

6,2,136,"00:16:01,437","00:16:03,904","Go and see your mother, Tommen.

"
6,2,138,"00:16:17,953","00:16:19,503","On the contrary.
"
6,2,139,"00:16:19,621","00:16:22,205","I fear a great deal.

"
6,2,142,"00:16:37,690","00:16:40,857","Do you know why we use these stones?

6,2,143,"00:16:42,528","00:16:45,445","To remind us not to fear death.

6,2,144,"00:16:45,531","00:16:48,815","We close our eyes on this world

6,2,146,"00:16:53,155","00:16:54,654","In truth, I fear that, too.
"
6,2,147,"00:16:54,790","00:16:57,708","You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.
"
6,2,148,"00:16:57,826","00:17:00,460","Your sister sought the gods' mercy
"
6,2,149,"00:17:00,546","00:17:02,329","and atoned for her sin.
"
6,2,150,"00:17:02,414","00:17:04,631","What about my sins?
"
6,2,151,"00:17:06,919","00:17:10,420","I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.
"
6,2,152,"00:17:12,307","00:17:14,725","I killed my own cousin.
"
6,2,153,"00:17:14,843","00:17:16,760","When the gods judged
my brother guilty,
"
6,2,154,"00:17:16,845","00:17:19,179","I helped him escape their justice.

6,2,155,"00:17:20,733","00:17:23,433","What atonement do I deserve?

6,2,157,"00:17:28,190","00:17:30,607","Oh, the gods won't mind.
"
6,2,158,"00:17:30,692","00:17:33,160","They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.
"
6,2,159,"00:17:35,114","00:17:37,280","Go on, then.
"
6,2,160,"00:17:37,366","00:17:41,001","I deserve it.
We all do.
"
6,2,161,"00:17:41,086","00:17:43,703","We are weak, vain creatures.
"
6,2,162,"00:17:43,789","00:17:46,673","We live only by the Mother's mercy.
"
6,2,163,"00:18:01,974","00:18:04,975","They should be closer if you

"
6,2,167,"00:18:11,817","00:18:14,785","No doubt many of us would fall.
"
6,2,168,"00:18:14,903","00:18:17,904","But who are we, hmm?
"
6,2,169,"00:18:18,040","00:18:20,707","We have no names, no family.
"
6,2,170,"00:18:20,793","00:18:24,711","Every one of us
is poor and powerless.
"
6,2,171,"00:18:24,797","00:18:27,214","And yet together,
"
6,2,172,"00:18:27,299","00:18:29,966","we can overthrow an empire.
"
6,2,173,"00:19:00,282","00:19:01,865","<i>Mother.</i>
"
6,2,174,"00:19:13,545","00:19:16,263","Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?
"
6,2,175,"00:19:17,799","00:19:19,466","Gold.
"
6,2,176,"00:19:19,601","00:19:22,052","Good. It was always her color.
"
6,2,177,"00:19:24,389","00:19:27,607","I'm sorry for keeping you here.
"
6,2,178,"00:19:29,978","00:19:32,362","<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>
"
6,2,179,"00:19:34,983","00:19:38,201","I didn't want to lose you again.
"
6,2,180,"00:19:38,320","00:19:40,120","I understand.
"
6,2,181,"00:19:42,324","00:19:44,124","I'm glad to see you.
"
6,2,182,"00:19:47,329","00:19:49,829","I know I should have come sooner.
"
6,2,183,"00:19:49,965","00:19:53,300","I wanted to.
I was wrong.
"
6,2,184,"00:19:54,670","00:19:56,586","It's all right.
"
6,2,185,"00:19:59,341","00:20:01,591","No, it isn't.
"
6,2,186,"00:20:03,345","00:20:06,012","I should have executed all of them.
"
6,2,187,"00:20:06,148","00:20:07,931","I should have pulled down the sept
"
6,2,188,"00:20:08,016","00:20:12,102","onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,
"
6,2,189,"00:20:12,187","00:20:14,521","as you would have for me.
"
6,2,190,"00:20:15,657","00:20:18,191","You raised me to be strong...
"
6,2,191,"00:20:20,362","00:20:21,945","and I wasn't.
"
6,2,192,"00:20:23,332","00:20:25,415","But I want to be.
"
6,2,193,"00:20:28,036","00:20:29,836","Help me.
"
6,2,194,"00:20:34,209","00:20:35,875","Always.
"
6,2,195,"00:21:04,122","00:21:06,790","If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.
"
6,2,196,"00:21:10,912","00:21:13,246","Meaning no offense.

6,2,197,"00:21:13,382","00:21:16,166","He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.
"
6,2,198,"00:21:16,251","00:21:17,550","I do not make dwarf jokes.
"
6,2,199,"00:21:17,636","00:21:19,753","You think them.
"
6,2,200,"00:21:19,838","00:21:24,257","So, the fleet.
It's been burned.
"
6,2,201,"00:21:24,393","00:21:28,178","We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.
"
6,2,202,"00:21:28,263","00:21:30,730","Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.
"
6,2,203,"00:21:30,816","00:21:33,900","Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.
"
6,2,204,"00:21:33,986","00:21:36,603","Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.
"
6,2,205,"00:21:36,738","00:21:39,189","The Masters have retaken both cities.
"
6,2,206,"00:21:39,274","00:21:43,943","Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.
"
6,2,207,"00:21:45,914","00:21:50,000","What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.
"
6,2,208,"00:21:50,118","00:21:51,835","They are not eating.
"
6,2,209,"00:21:51,953","00:21:54,704","They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.
"
6,2,210,"00:21:54,790","00:21:57,507","Daenerys is the dragon queen.
"
6,2,211,"00:21:57,626","00:22:00,460","Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.
"
6,2,212,"00:22:00,545","00:22:03,880","If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?
"
6,2,213,"00:22:03,965","00:22:06,266","Dragons do not do well in captivity.
"
6,2,214,"00:22:06,351","00:22:08,718","- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.
"
6,2,215,"00:22:08,804","00:22:11,771","I drink and I know things.
"
6,2,216,"00:22:13,809","00:22:16,976","The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros
"
6,2,217,"00:22:17,062","00:22:19,562","ranged over hundreds of miles.
"
6,2,218,"00:22:19,648","00:22:21,448","Then Daenerys's ancestors
"
6,2,219,"00:22:21,533","00:22:24,367","started chaining them up in pens.
"
6,2,220,"00:22:24,486","00:22:26,453","A few generations later,
"
6,2,221,"00:22:26,538","00:22:30,206","the last dragons
were no larger than cats.
"
6,2,222,"00:22:30,325","00:22:33,243","They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.
"
6,2,223,"00:22:34,830","00:22:36,796","Missandei,
"
6,2,224,"00:22:36,882","00:22:40,417","how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?
"
6,2,225,"00:22:40,502","00:22:44,170","- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?
"
6,2,226,"00:22:44,306","00:22:46,306","Never.
"
6,2,227,"00:22:46,391","00:22:48,558","Dragons are intelligent.
"
6,2,228,"00:22:48,677","00:22:51,511","More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.
"
6,2,229,"00:22:51,596","00:22:53,930","They have affection for their friends
"
6,2,230,"00:22:54,015","00:22:55,849","and fury for their enemies.
"
6,2,231,"00:22:57,519","00:23:00,019","- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?
"
6,2,232,"00:23:00,155","00:23:03,189","They will. It's time
they had their supper.
"
6,2,233,"00:24:34,199","00:24:36,499","I'm friends with your mother.
"
6,2,234,"00:24:43,341","00:24:45,959","I'm here to help.

"
6,2,237,"00:24:54,436","00:24:58,054","an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.
"
6,2,238,"00:24:58,139","00:25:00,773","I begged him for one of you.
"
6,2,239,"00:25:00,859","00:25:04,360","""It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon,"" I told him.

6,2,240,"00:25:06,231","00:25:08,448","""It could be little
like me.""
"
6,2,241,"00:25:15,156","00:25:19,292","Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.
"
6,2,242,"00:25:20,629","00:25:22,829","Then my father told me
"
6,2,243,"00:25:22,914","00:25:26,833","the last dragon had died
a century ago.
"
6,2,244,"00:25:26,968","00:25:30,053","I cried myself to sleep that night.

6,2,250,"00:27:17,579","00:27:20,947","- No one.

6,2,449,"00:44:46,076","00:44:48,243","The former Lord Commander.
"
6,2,450,"00:44:49,880","00:44:51,380","Does he have to be?
"
6,2,451,"00:44:54,835","00:44:57,085","What are you asking?
"
6,2,452,"00:45:01,008","00:45:04,810","Do you know of any magic...
"
6,2,453,"00:45:06,513","00:45:08,146","that could help him?
"
6,2,454,"00:45:08,232","00:45:09,598","Bring him back?

leave him be.

6,2,457,"00:45:14,688","00:45:17,239","There are some with this power.

- I don't know.
"
6,2,459,"00:45:20,027","00:45:21,076","Have you seen it done?

6,2,460,"00:45:24,331","00:45:26,782","I met a man who came
back from the dead,
"
6,2,461,"00:45:26,867","00:45:30,001","but the priest
who did it--
"
6,2,462,"00:45:30,087","00:45:32,003","it shouldn't have been possible.
"
6,2,463,"00:45:32,089","00:45:35,257","But it was.
It could be now.
"
6,2,464,"00:45:35,375","00:45:37,676","Not for me.
"
6,2,465,"00:45:41,849","00:45:43,882","Not for you?
"
6,2,466,"00:45:47,554","00:45:51,223","I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.
"
6,2,467,"00:45:51,308","00:45:54,392","I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

"
6,2,472,"00:46:08,742","00:46:11,493","The Lord never spoke to me.
"
6,2,473,"00:46:11,578","00:46:13,545","Fuck him, then.
"
6,2,474,"00:46:13,630","00:46:15,547","Fuck all of them.
"
6,2,475,"00:46:17,301","00:46:20,969","I'm not a devout man, obviously.

think the sea was called the see

you there or for Little Sam.

"
6,3,84,"00:10:35,700","00:10:39,234","to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

something at me and stormed off.

the father of my son.

6,3,117,"00:15:32,929","00:15:34,963","He's better than my father.

6,3,118,"00:15:35,065","00:15:36,598","Far better.
"
6,3,119,"00:15:41,705","00:15:43,671","But Father beat him.
"
6,3,120,"00:15:43,773","00:15:45,840","Did he?

6,3,124,"00:16:28,621","00:16:30,352","What's in the tower?

6,3,125,"00:16:30,454","00:16:32,154","That's enough for one day.

6,3,126,"00:16:32,256","00:16:33,955","We'll visit again another time.

"
6,3,137,"00:17:26,076","00:17:28,843","I've told you many times, stay too long
"
6,3,138,"00:17:28,945","00:17:31,379","where you don't belong and
you will never return.
"
6,3,139,"00:17:31,482","00:17:33,281","Why do I want to return?
"
6,3,140,"00:17:33,383","00:17:35,150","So I can be a cripple again?
"
6,3,141,"00:17:35,252","00:17:37,685","So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
"
6,3,142,"00:17:37,787","00:17:39,821","You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years
"
6,3,143,"00:17:39,923","00:17:41,789","watching the world from a distance
"
6,3,144,"00:17:41,891","00:17:43,291","as the roots grew through me?
"
6,3,145,"00:17:43,393","00:17:45,059","So why did you?
"
6,3,146,"00:17:46,230","00:17:47,962","I was waiting for you.
"
6,3,147,"00:17:48,064","00:17:49,831","I don't want to be you.
"
6,3,148,"00:17:50,487","00:17:52,567","I don't blame you.
"
6,3,149,"00:17:53,903","00:17:56,138","You won't be here forever.
"
6,3,150,"00:17:56,240","00:17:58,840","You won't be an old man in a tree.
"
6,3,151,"00:17:58,942","00:18:01,376","But before you leave,
"
6,3,152,"00:18:01,478","00:18:04,446","you must learn.
"
6,3,153,"00:18:04,548","00:18:06,381","Learn what?
"
6,3,154,"00:18:06,483","00:18:09,083","Everything.

"
6,3,206,"00:23:01,711","00:23:04,913","That's your name, isn't it, Vala?
"
6,3,207,"00:23:05,014","00:23:07,315","That's all right.
"
6,3,208,"00:23:07,417","00:23:10,552","I know who you are and what you've done.
"
6,3,209,"00:23:12,422","00:23:13,721","You've done a lot.
"
6,3,210,"00:23:13,824","00:23:16,290","You've sacrificed your body for a cause,
"
6,3,211,"00:23:16,392","00:23:19,727","which is more than most people do.
"
6,3,212,"00:23:19,830","00:23:22,931","And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy
"
6,3,213,"00:23:23,032","00:23:25,800","murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.
"
6,3,214,"00:23:25,902","00:23:29,236","The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers
"
6,3,215,"00:23:29,339","00:23:31,372","brought here by a foreign queen
"
6,3,216,"00:23:31,475","00:23:34,175","to destroy our city and our history.
"
6,3,217,"00:23:34,277","00:23:37,111","I understand.
"
6,3,218,"00:23:37,213","00:23:39,881","Well, that makes perfect sense
"
6,3,219,"00:23:39,983","00:23:42,717","from your perspective.
"
6,3,220,"00:23:42,819","00:23:46,588","I have a different
perspective, of course.
"
6,3,221,"00:23:46,690","00:23:50,157","I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective
"
6,3,222,"00:23:50,259","00:23:52,627","just as I will try to
see them from yours.
"
6,3,223,"00:23:52,729","00:23:54,929","Because that is the only way
"
6,3,224,"00:23:55,031","00:23:57,932","that I can make you and Dom happy.
"
6,3,225,"00:24:01,037","00:24:04,839","That is how you pronounce it... Dom?
"
6,3,226,"00:24:04,941","00:24:07,942","I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.
"
6,3,227,"00:24:09,479","00:24:11,379","Such a handsome boy.
"
6,3,228,"00:24:11,481","00:24:15,016","Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.
"
6,3,229,"00:24:15,118","00:24:19,253","Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?
"
6,3,230,"00:24:19,355","00:24:22,223","You won't torture me, you'll
just threaten my son.
"
6,3,231,"00:24:22,325","00:24:24,759","Children are blameless.
"
6,3,232,"00:24:25,795","00:24:27,996","I have never hurt them.
"
6,3,233,"00:24:28,097","00:24:30,431","Your boy is in no immediate danger,
"
6,3,234,"00:24:30,534","00:24:32,099","this I swear to you.
"
6,3,235,"00:24:34,070","00:24:35,970","But between us, dear,
"
6,3,236,"00:24:36,072","00:24:39,206","you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.
"
6,3,237,"00:24:39,308","00:24:41,876","We both know the penalty for that crime.
"
6,3,238,"00:24:46,983","00:24:50,652","How will poor Dom get
on without his mother?
"
6,3,239,"00:24:50,754","00:24:52,787","And with his breathing problem.
"
6,3,240,"00:24:52,889","00:24:55,222","If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.
"
6,3,241,"00:24:55,324","00:24:57,491","So either you kill me or they do.
"
6,3,242,"00:24:57,594","00:25:01,128","Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.
"
6,3,243,"00:25:02,666","00:25:04,699","There is a third option, though.
"
6,3,244,"00:25:04,801","00:25:08,002","A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.
"
6,3,245,"00:25:08,104","00:25:12,740","I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.
"
6,3,246,"00:25:12,842","00:25:16,277","I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.
"
6,3,247,"00:25:16,379","00:25:18,145","Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
"
6,3,248,"00:25:18,247","00:25:21,950","one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.
"
6,3,249,"00:25:22,052","00:25:23,751","Far too heavy for me.
"
6,3,250,"00:25:25,121","00:25:26,988","The boat sails at dawn.
"
6,3,251,"00:25:27,090","00:25:29,857","You need to decide now.
"
6,3,252,"00:25:29,960","00:25:32,727","A new life for you and Dom
"
6,3,253,"00:25:32,829","00:25:34,462","or...
"
6,3,254,"00:25:50,513","00:25:52,313","What should we do while we wait?
"
6,3,255,"00:25:52,415","00:25:54,215","To pass the time, what should we do?
"
6,3,256,"00:25:54,317","00:25:56,651","What should we talk about?
"
6,3,257,"00:25:58,989","00:26:00,755","You speak 19 languages.
"
6,3,258,"00:26:00,857","00:26:04,191","You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.
"
6,3,259,"00:26:04,293","00:26:07,528","You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.
"
6,3,260,"00:26:07,631","00:26:10,798","What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?
"
6,3,261,"00:26:11,868","00:26:13,835","Patrol.
"
6,3,262,"00:26:13,937","00:26:16,570","When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.
"
6,3,263,"00:26:16,673","00:26:19,240","What we see on patrol.
"
6,3,264,"00:26:19,342","00:26:21,275","Who we captured on patrol.
"
6,3,265,"00:26:21,377","00:26:23,845","That's good. That's very good.
"
6,3,266,"00:26:25,949","00:26:28,349","But that's a report.
"
6,3,267,"00:26:28,451","00:26:30,652","I was thinking more of a conversation.
"
6,3,268,"00:26:30,754","00:26:33,788","A wise man once said the
true history of the world
"
6,3,269,"00:26:33,890","00:26:37,291","is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.
"
6,3,270,"00:26:37,393","00:26:39,293","Who said this?
"
6,3,271,"00:26:39,395","00:26:41,763","Me.
"
6,3,272,"00:26:41,865","00:26:43,831","Just now.
"
6,3,273,"00:26:50,173","00:26:52,406","All right, no conversations.
"
6,3,274,"00:26:52,508","00:26:54,375","Let's play a game.
"
6,3,275,"00:26:57,246","00:26:59,013","You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?
"
6,3,276,"00:26:59,115","00:27:00,347","Games are for children.
"
6,3,277,"00:27:00,449","00:27:04,452","My master Kraznys would
sometimes make us play games.
"
6,3,278,"00:27:04,453","00:27:06,187","There, that's a start.
"
6,3,279,"00:27:06,289","00:27:09,957","- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.
"
6,3,280,"00:27:10,060","00:27:12,026","Not that. Of course not that.
"
6,3,281,"00:27:13,396","00:27:15,629","Innocent games. Fun games.
"
6,3,282,"00:27:15,732","00:27:17,231","Drinking games.
"
6,3,283,"00:27:17,333","00:27:19,533","We do not drink.
"
6,3,284,"00:27:19,635","00:27:21,635","Until you do.
"
6,3,285,"00:27:23,372","00:27:25,506","All right. No drinking.
"
6,3,286,"00:27:25,608","00:27:27,141","We can play without drinking.
"
6,3,287,"00:27:27,243","00:27:29,410","It's a wonderful game. I invented it.
"
6,3,288,"00:27:29,512","00:27:31,012","Here's how it works.
"
6,3,289,"00:27:31,114","00:27:33,081","I make a statement about your past.
"
6,3,290,"00:27:33,183","00:27:34,816","If I'm wrong, I drink.
"
6,3,291,"00:27:34,918","00:27:38,019","And if I'm right...
"
6,3,292,"00:27:38,121","00:27:41,522","maybe we can't play without drinking.
"
6,3,293,"00:27:43,292","00:27:45,760","Oh, you took your time.
"
6,3,294,"00:27:45,862","00:27:47,829","Sorry.
"
6,3,295,"00:27:47,931","00:27:51,565","I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.
"
6,3,296,"00:27:51,667","00:27:53,701","- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?
"
6,3,297,"00:27:53,803","00:27:55,937","The Good Masters of Astapor
"
6,3,298,"00:27:56,039","00:27:58,206","and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.
"
6,3,299,"00:27:58,307","00:28:01,308","With help from their
friends in Volantis.
"
6,3,300,"00:28:01,410","00:28:02,844","You see?
"
6,3,301,"00:28:02,946","00:28:05,446","You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.
"
6,3,302,"00:28:05,548","00:28:07,081","We only have to worry about
"
6,3,303,"00:28:07,183","00:28:09,383","the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.
"
6,3,304,"00:28:09,485","00:28:11,119","We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.
"
6,3,305,"00:28:11,221","00:28:13,054","We will do it again and
execute the Masters.
"
6,3,306,"00:28:13,156","00:28:16,557","If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

"
6,3,474,"00:37:18,100","00:37:20,834","then we accept it, all
of us, even kings.
"
6,3,475,"00:37:20,936","00:37:25,205","A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.
"
6,3,476,"00:37:25,308","00:37:27,741","And no one is wiser than the gods.
"
6,3,477,"00:37:30,313","00:37:33,480","My grandfather once
said something similar.
"
6,3,478,"00:37:33,582","00:37:35,416","Except for the part about the gods.
"
6,3,479,"00:37:35,518","00:37:39,420","The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.
"
6,3,480,"00:37:40,690","00:37:42,723","As they work through your mother.
"
6,3,481,"00:37:44,993","00:37:47,027","There's so much good in all of us.
"
6,3,482,"00:37:47,129","00:37:50,831","The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.
"
6,3,483,"00:38:19,061","00:38:20,828","Who are you?
"
6,3,484,"00:38:20,929","00:38:22,329","No one.
"
6,3,485,"00:38:24,233","00:38:26,734","Who were you before you came here?

6,3,486,"00:38:26,836","00:38:28,469","Arya Stark.
"
6,3,487,"00:38:30,473","00:38:33,039","Tell me about Arya Stark's family.
"
6,3,488,"00:38:33,141","00:38:36,009","Her father was Eddard Stark.
"
6,3,489,"00:38:36,111","00:38:38,645","Her mother was Catelyn Stark.
"
6,3,490,"00:38:38,748","00:38:42,082","She had one sister, Sansa,
"
6,3,491,"00:38:42,184","00:38:44,084","and four brothers.
"
6,3,492,"00:38:53,796","00:38:55,562","Three brothers.
"
6,3,493,"00:38:55,664","00:38:58,465","Robb, Bran, Rickon.
"
6,3,494,"00:39:00,436","00:39:03,336","And a half-brother Jon.
"
6,3,495,"00:39:04,507","00:39:06,840","And where are they now?
"
6,3,496,"00:39:06,942","00:39:09,910","They may be dead for all a girl knows.
"
6,3,497,"00:39:20,188","00:39:21,622","Tell me about the Hound.
"
6,3,498,"00:39:23,526","00:39:25,258","Also dead.
"
6,3,499,"00:39:35,438","00:39:38,639","Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.
"
6,3,500,"00:39:41,109","00:39:44,210","He was not on her list anymore.
"
6,3,501,"00:39:44,313","00:39:46,046","She had taken him off it.
"
6,3,502,"00:39:46,148","00:39:50,216","Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?
"
6,3,503,"00:39:54,056","00:39:56,323","She did and she did not.
"
6,3,504,"00:39:59,829","00:40:02,963","She sounds confused.
"
6,3,505,"00:40:07,603","00:40:11,472","Yes, she was.
"
6,3,506,"00:40:15,678","00:40:18,411","Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?
"
6,3,507,"00:40:19,427","00:40:21,515","Cersei Lannister.
"
6,3,508,"00:40:23,085","00:40:24,250","Gregor Clegane.

"
6,3,510,"00:40:31,360","00:40:34,094","That's a short list.
"
6,3,511,"00:40:37,967","00:40:40,601","That can't be everyone you want to kill.
"
6,3,512,"00:40:43,271","00:40:45,906","Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?
"
6,3,513,"00:40:48,911","00:40:52,012","Which name would you
like a girl to speak?
"
6,3,514,"00:41:27,950","00:41:30,083","If a girl tells me her name,
"
6,3,515,"00:41:30,185","00:41:32,586","I will give her eyes back.
"
6,3,516,"00:41:35,524","00:41:37,490","A girl has no name.
"
6,3,517,"00:41:41,196","00:41:42,228","Come.
"
6,3,518,"00:42:15,764","00:42:17,898","If a girl is truly no one,
"
6,3,519,"00:42:18,000","00:42:20,433","she has nothing to fear.
"
6,3,520,"00:42:45,761","00:42:47,894","Who are you?
"
6,3,521,"00:42:51,299","00:42:53,166","No one.
"
6,3,522,"00:43:02,745","00:43:05,879","The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
"
6,3,523,"00:43:05,981","00:43:08,448","Famously loyal to the Starks.
"
6,3,524,"00:43:08,550","00:43:11,584","And you, Lord Karstark.
"
6,3,525,"00:43:11,687","00:43:14,487","Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?
"
6,3,526,"00:43:14,589","00:43:17,223","But here we are. Times change.
"
6,3,527,"00:43:17,325","00:43:19,626","When my father became
Warden of the North,
"
6,3,528,"00:43:19,728","00:43:21,728","your house refused to
pledge their banners.
"
6,3,529,"00:43:21,830","00:43:23,596","Your father was a cunt.
"
6,3,530,"00:43:26,802","00:43:29,036","My beloved father, the Warden...
"
6,3,531,"00:43:29,138","00:43:32,272","Your father was a cunt and
that's why you killed him.
"
6,3,532,"00:43:32,374","00:43:35,208","I might have done the same to my father
"
6,3,533,"00:43:35,310","00:43:37,878","if he hadn't have done me the
favor of dying on his own.
"
6,3,534,"00:43:37,980","00:43:40,781","My father was poisoned by our enemies.
"
6,3,535,"00:43:42,718","00:43:46,019","Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?
"
6,3,536,"00:43:46,121","00:43:49,956","The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.
"
6,3,537,"00:43:50,059","00:43:52,458","We're farther north than
any of you fuckers.
"
6,3,538,"00:43:52,561","00:43:55,829","Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.
"
6,3,539,"00:43:55,931","00:43:59,166","I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.
"
6,3,540,"00:43:59,267","00:44:02,002","But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.
"
6,3,541,"00:44:02,104","00:44:04,971","So now you've come seeking help?
"
6,3,542,"00:44:05,074","00:44:07,407","We need to help each other.
"
6,3,543,"00:44:07,509","00:44:11,078","The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.
"
6,3,544,"00:44:11,180","00:44:13,146","Won't take them long to get here.
"
6,3,545,"00:44:13,248","00:44:16,083","You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?
"
6,3,546,"00:44:16,185","00:44:17,751","If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.
"
6,3,547,"00:44:17,853","00:44:20,320","He knows this place
better than we ever will.
"
6,3,548,"00:44:23,458","00:44:25,592","Pledge your banners to House Bolton.
"
6,3,549,"00:44:25,694","00:44:28,228","Swear loyalty to me as
Warden of the North
"
6,3,550,"00:44:28,330","00:44:30,831","and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard
"
6,3,551,"00:44:30,933","00:44:32,432","and all his wildling friends.
"
6,3,552,"00:44:32,534","00:44:34,735","I'm not kissing your fucking hand.
"
6,3,553,"00:44:34,837","00:44:37,437","Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.
"
6,3,554,"00:44:37,539","00:44:39,572","I'm not doing that either.
"
6,3,555,"00:44:39,674","00:44:42,609","Why would I trust a man who
won't honor tradition?
"
6,3,556,"00:44:42,711","00:44:45,545","Your father honored tradition.
"
6,3,557,"00:44:45,647","00:44:47,848","Knelt for Robb Stark.
"
6,3,558,"00:44:47,950","00:44:50,350","Called him King of the North.
"
6,3,559,"00:44:50,452","00:44:52,619","Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?
"
6,3,560,"00:44:52,721","00:44:54,520","Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.
"
6,3,561,"00:44:54,623","00:44:57,758","Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
"
6,3,562,"00:44:57,860","00:44:59,459","I've got a gift for you.
"
6,3,563,"00:45:02,397","00:45:05,165","A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.
"
6,3,564,"00:45:05,267","00:45:08,235","A girl, aye.
"
6,3,565,"00:45:09,604","00:45:11,638","A wild one.
"
6,3,566,"00:45:19,314","00:45:21,148","I like them wild.
"
6,3,567,"00:45:22,217","00:45:25,718","And the boy, nice and young.
"
6,3,568,"00:45:25,821","00:45:27,988","The way Karstark likes them.
"
6,3,569,"00:45:33,796","00:45:35,262","Who's this?
"
6,3,570,"00:45:35,363","00:45:37,730","Rickon Stark.
"
6,3,571,"00:45:44,840","00:45:47,140","How do I know that's Rickon Stark?
"
6,3,572,"00:46:17,806","00:46:20,673","Welcome home, Lord Stark.
"
6,3,573,"00:46:32,120","00:46:33,887","It's time.
"
6,3,574,"00:47:11,293","00:47:14,394","If you have any last
words, now is the time.
"
6,3,575,"00:47:14,496","00:47:16,763","You shouldn't be alive.
"
6,3,576,"00:47:16,865","00:47:18,798","It's not right.
"
6,3,577,"00:47:19,968","00:47:21,768","Neither was killing me.
"
6,3,578,"00:47:26,108","00:47:28,741","My mother's still
living at White Harbor.
"
6,3,579,"00:47:28,843","00:47:30,743","Could you write her?
"
6,3,580,"00:47:30,845","00:47:33,146","Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.
"
6,3,581,"00:47:41,556","00:47:45,292","I had a choice, Lord Commander.
"
6,3,582,"00:47:45,394","00:47:49,362","Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.
"
6,3,583,"00:47:49,464","00:47:52,532","You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.
"
6,3,584,"00:47:54,403","00:47:57,270","An army of murderers and raiders.
"
6,3,585,"00:47:57,372","00:48:01,074","If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,
"
6,3,586,"00:48:01,176","00:48:04,610","I pray I'd make the right choice again.
"
6,3,587,"00:48:04,712","00:48:06,746","I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.
"
6,3,588,"00:48:06,848","00:48:09,849","I fought, I lost.
"
6,3,589,"00:48:11,686","00:48:13,619","Now I rest.
"
6,3,590,"00:48:14,622","00:48:18,524","But you, Lord Snow,
"
6,3,591,"00:48:18,626","00:48:21,027","you'll be fighting
their battles forever.
"
6,3,592,"00:50:08,203","00:50:10,136","We should burn the bodies.

ghost will come back and murder me.
"
6,4,39,"00:06:04,949","00:06:06,581","Where will we go?
"
6,4,40,"00:06:06,683","00:06:09,184","I can't stay here, not
after what happened.
"
6,4,41,"00:06:09,287","00:06:11,320","There's only one place we can go.
"
6,4,42,"00:06:11,422","00:06:13,522","Home.
"
6,4,43,"00:06:14,825","00:06:16,858","Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?
"
6,4,44,"00:06:16,961","00:06:18,593","We'll take it back from them.
"
6,4,45,"00:06:21,698","00:06:23,032","I don't have an army.
"
6,4,46,"00:06:23,754","00:06:25,234","How many wildlings did you save?
"
6,4,47,"00:06:25,336","00:06:26,936","They didn't come here to serve me.
"
6,4,48,"00:06:27,038","00:06:29,305","They owe you their lives.
"
6,4,49,"00:06:29,407","00:06:32,574","You think they'll be safe here if Roose
Bolton remains Warden of the North?
"
6,4,50,"00:06:32,676","00:06:35,044","- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.
"
6,4,51,"00:06:35,146","00:06:38,647","It's ours and Arya's and
Bran's and Rickon's.
"
6,4,52,"00:06:38,749","00:06:40,882","Wherever they are, it
belongs to our family.
"
6,4,53,"00:06:40,985","00:06:42,318","We have to fight for it.
"
6,4,54,"00:06:42,420","00:06:44,553","I'm tired of fighting.
"
6,4,55,"00:06:46,457","00:06:49,325","It's all I've done since I left home.
"
6,4,56,"00:06:49,427","00:06:51,360","I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.
"
6,4,57,"00:06:51,462","00:06:54,129","I've killed wildlings. I've
killed men that I admire.
"
6,4,58,"00:06:54,231","00:06:57,666","I hanged a boy younger than Bran.
"
6,4,59,"00:07:00,171","00:07:04,506","I fought and I lost.
"
6,4,60,"00:07:08,346","00:07:11,847","If we don't take back the
North, we'll never be safe.
"
6,4,61,"00:07:13,650","00:07:15,750","I want you to help me.
"
6,4,62,"00:07:17,254","00:07:19,855","But I'll do it myself if I have to.
"
6,4,63,"00:07:22,926","00:07:25,094","My lady.
"
6,4,64,"00:07:26,163","00:07:27,796","Ser Davos.
"
6,4,65,"00:07:29,700","00:07:32,801","Will you stay here at Castle Black?
"
6,4,66,"00:07:32,903","00:07:36,638","I will do as Jon Snow commands.
"
6,4,67,"00:07:36,740","00:07:38,540","You serve Jon Snow now?
"
6,4,68,"00:07:39,877","00:07:41,943","He's the prince that was promised.
"
6,4,69,"00:07:43,680","00:07:46,448","Forgive me, my lady, I
thought that was Stannis.
"
6,4,70,"00:07:56,394","00:07:58,527","What happened down there?
"
6,4,71,"00:08:00,797","00:08:03,798","There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.
"
6,4,72,"00:08:05,802","00:08:07,936","And Shireen?
"
6,4,73,"00:08:08,039","00:08:09,571","What happened to the princess?
"
6,4,74,"00:08:09,673","00:08:12,374","I saw what happened.
"
6,4,75,"00:08:12,476","00:08:15,310","I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.
"
6,4,76,"00:08:15,413","00:08:17,312","My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.
"
6,4,77,"00:08:17,415","00:08:19,014","We've met before.
"
6,4,78,"00:08:19,116","00:08:20,849","I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.
"
6,4,79,"00:08:20,951","00:08:25,087","Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.
"
6,4,80,"00:08:26,323","00:08:27,889","That's in the past now.
"
6,4,81,"00:08:29,460","00:08:31,193","Yes, it's in the past.
"
6,4,82,"00:08:31,295","00:08:33,828","It doesn't mean I forget.
"
6,4,83,"00:08:35,599","00:08:36,898","Or forgive.
"
6,4,84,"00:08:38,802","00:08:40,402","He admitted it, you know.
"
6,4,85,"00:08:40,504","00:08:42,304","Who did?
"
6,4,86,"00:08:42,406","00:08:44,473","Stannis.
"
6,4,87,"00:08:44,575","00:08:46,708","Just before I executed him.
"
6,4,88,"00:09:32,523","00:09:34,689","The Defender of the Vale!
"
6,4,89,"00:09:34,791","00:09:36,425","Uncle Petyr!
"
6,4,90,"00:09:43,334","00:09:44,899","My lord.
"
6,4,91,"00:09:45,002","00:09:46,568","Come and see.
"
6,4,92,"00:09:46,670","00:09:49,304","I missed your name day. Go on.
"
6,4,93,"00:09:51,869","00:09:53,708","A falcon!
"
6,4,94,"00:09:53,810","00:09:55,177","A gyrfalcon.
"
6,4,95,"00:09:55,279","00:09:56,745","The greatest and rarest of birds.
"
6,4,96,"00:09:56,847","00:09:59,548","Last time I saw you, Baelish,
"
6,4,97,"00:09:59,650","00:10:03,852","you told me you were taking Sansa
Stark home with you to the Fingers.
"
6,4,98,"00:10:03,954","00:10:05,220","Indeed I was.
"
6,4,99,"00:10:05,322","00:10:07,523","And yet not long ago,
we received reports
"
6,4,100,"00:10:07,625","00:10:10,725","that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
"
6,4,101,"00:10:10,827","00:10:14,396","On our way to the Fingers, we were set
upon by a large force of Bolton men.
"
6,4,102,"00:10:14,498","00:10:17,102","Seemed to know exactly
when we were traveling
"
6,4,103,"00:10:17,103","00:10:19,068","and exactly whom we were transporting.
"
6,4,104,"00:10:19,069","00:10:20,769","Do you take me for a fool?
"
6,4,105,"00:10:20,871","00:10:23,738","Tell me, Lord Royce,
"
6,4,106,"00:10:23,840","00:10:27,209","how many people knew of my
travel plans with Sansa Stark?
"
6,4,107,"00:10:27,311","00:10:30,612","I shared my intentions with you
"
6,4,108,"00:10:30,714","00:10:32,847","and no one else.
"
6,4,109,"00:10:32,949","00:10:36,718","Slander a man in his own home,
"
6,4,110,"00:10:36,820","00:10:39,621","you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.
"
6,4,111,"00:10:39,723","00:10:44,359","Your home is the Vale. The Lord
of the Vale stands before us.
"
6,4,112,"00:10:44,461","00:10:47,229","And only his judgment concerns me.
"
6,4,113,"00:10:53,170","00:10:55,337","Shall we throw him
through the Moon Door?
"
6,4,114,"00:11:02,413","00:11:04,513","My lord.
"
6,4,115,"00:11:04,615","00:11:09,184","My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.
"
6,4,116,"00:11:09,286","00:11:12,254","To your father, to your
mother, and now to you.
"
6,4,117,"00:11:13,624","00:11:14,856","Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?
"
6,4,118,"00:11:23,166","00:11:26,268","Lord Royce has served the Vale well.
"
6,4,119,"00:11:26,370","00:11:30,105","He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.
"
6,4,120,"00:11:30,207","00:11:33,742","If we could trust his absolute loyalty,
"
6,4,121,"00:11:33,844","00:11:36,411","he would make a capable
commander in the wars to come.
"
6,4,122,"00:11:40,016","00:11:43,518","You can trust my absolute
loyalty, my lord.
"
6,4,123,"00:11:43,621","00:11:46,421","I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?
"
6,4,124,"00:11:53,397","00:11:55,029","Fine.
"
6,4,125,"00:12:02,306","00:12:04,573","I bring good news.
"
6,4,126,"00:12:04,675","00:12:07,242","My friends in the North tell me
Sansa has escaped Winterfell.
"
6,4,127,"00:12:07,344","00:12:09,110","I expect she's headed to Castle Black
"
6,4,128,"00:12:09,212","00:12:11,546","where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.
"
6,4,129,"00:12:11,649","00:12:15,850","But she won't be safe there, not
with the Boltons after her.
"
6,4,130,"00:12:17,888","00:12:19,755","She's my cousin.
"
6,4,131,"00:12:22,526","00:12:23,592","We should help her.
"
6,4,132,"00:12:23,694","00:12:26,361","That was my instinct as well.
"
6,4,133,"00:12:26,463","00:12:28,997","Our lord has spoken.
"
6,4,134,"00:12:30,601","00:12:32,534","Gather the Knights of the Vale.
"
6,4,135,"00:12:32,636","00:12:35,671","The time has come to join the fray.
"
6,4,136,"00:12:39,910","00:12:42,043","You invite the enemy into our city?
"
6,4,137,"00:12:42,145","00:12:43,812","I did.
"
6,4,138,"00:12:43,914","00:12:46,381","As a clever man once told me,
"
6,4,139,"00:12:46,483","00:12:49,150","""We make peace with our
enemies, not our friends.""
"
6,4,140,"00:12:49,252","00:12:52,220","I don't make peace with
the queen's enemies.
"
6,4,141,"00:12:52,323","00:12:53,422","I kill the queen's enemies.
"
6,4,142,"00:12:53,524","00:12:54,989","Yes, that's the military approach.
"
6,4,143,"00:12:55,091","00:12:56,658","And how has that worked here in Meereen?
"
6,4,144,"00:12:56,760","00:12:59,060","I represent the diplomatic approach.
"
6,4,145,"00:12:59,162","00:13:01,296","Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters
"
6,4,146,"00:13:01,398","00:13:03,365","and they tried to murder her.
"
6,4,147,"00:13:03,467","00:13:06,401","We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.
"
6,4,148,"00:13:06,503","00:13:09,805","Trust me. My own recent
experience with slavery
"
6,4,149,"00:13:09,906","00:13:11,807","has taught me the horrors
of that institution.
"
6,4,150,"00:13:11,908","00:13:13,308","How many days were you a slave?
"
6,4,151,"00:13:13,888","00:13:15,377","Long enough to know.
"
6,4,152,"00:13:15,479","00:13:18,513","Not long enough to understand.
"
6,4,153,"00:13:24,020","00:13:28,590","I bought this dwarf for
a single gold honor.
"
6,4,154,"00:13:28,692","00:13:30,759","And somehow you've risen
"
6,4,155,"00:13:30,861","00:13:33,762","to the top of the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.
"
6,4,156,"00:13:33,864","00:13:35,664","It's most impressive.
"
6,4,157,"00:13:35,766","00:13:38,600","And now you speak for the
Good Masters of Astapor.
"
6,4,158,"00:13:38,702","00:13:41,035","Here's to reversals of fortune.
"
6,4,159,"00:13:41,137","00:13:42,704","We came here to meet the queen
"
6,4,160,"00:13:42,806","00:13:45,206","and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.
"
6,4,161,"00:13:45,308","00:13:49,110","Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.
"
6,4,162,"00:13:49,212","00:13:52,146","We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.
"
6,4,163,"00:13:52,249","00:13:55,950","Take your dragons and
your mercenaries and go.
"
6,4,164,"00:13:56,052","00:13:58,620","Queen Daenerys won't
stay in Meereen forever.
"
6,4,165,"00:13:58,722","00:14:00,489","Her path takes her westward.
"
6,4,166,"00:14:00,591","00:14:02,924","When we last met, I offered her ships
"
6,4,167,"00:14:03,026","00:14:06,895","so she could return to Westeros where
she belongs. She refused them.
"
6,4,168,"00:14:06,997","00:14:09,097","She refused them because
hundreds of thousands
"
6,4,169,"00:14:09,199","00:14:11,165","of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.
"
6,4,170,"00:14:11,268","00:14:13,702","As they have since the dawn of time.
"
6,4,171,"00:14:13,804","00:14:16,971","- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?
"
6,4,172,"00:14:17,073","00:14:18,907","You still follow orders.
"
6,4,173,"00:14:19,009","00:14:21,543","Just because your master
has silver hair and tits
"
6,4,174,"00:14:21,645","00:14:23,378","doesn't mean she's not a master.
"
6,4,175,"00:14:23,480","00:14:26,915","Friends, friends, friends, please.
"
6,4,176,"00:14:27,017","00:14:31,553","There have always been those with wealth
and power and those with nothing.
"
6,4,177,"00:14:31,655","00:14:34,656","That is the way of the world. I'm not
here to change the way of the world.
"
6,4,178,"00:14:34,758","00:14:37,225","Slavery is the way of our world.
"
6,4,179,"00:14:37,327","00:14:40,796","You don't need slaves to make money.
"
6,4,180,"00:14:40,898","00:14:43,765","There haven't been slaves in
Westeros for hundreds of years
"
6,4,181,"00:14:43,867","00:14:45,801","and I grew up richer than any of you.
"
6,4,182,"00:14:47,838","00:14:51,506","But our queen recognizes that she erred
"
6,4,183,"00:14:51,608","00:14:54,242","by abolishing slavery
"
6,4,184,"00:14:54,344","00:14:57,178","without providing a new
system to replace it.
"
6,4,185,"00:14:57,280","00:15:01,049","So here is the queen's proposal.
"
6,4,186,"00:15:01,151","00:15:04,018","Slavery will never return to Meereen,
"
6,4,187,"00:15:04,120","00:15:06,855","but she will give the other
cities of Slaver's Bay
"
6,4,188,"00:15:06,957","00:15:08,924","time to adjust to the new order.
"
6,4,189,"00:15:09,025","00:15:10,325","What does that mean?
"
6,4,190,"00:15:10,427","00:15:13,562","Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,
"
6,4,191,"00:15:13,664","00:15:16,397","we will give you seven
years to end the practice.
"
6,4,192,"00:15:21,505","00:15:23,338","Slaveholders will be compensated
"
6,4,193,"00:15:23,440","00:15:26,174","for their losses, of
course, at fair prices.
"
6,4,194,"00:15:26,276","00:15:28,777","In exchange, you will cut off
"
6,4,195,"00:15:28,879","00:15:30,612","your support for the Sons of the Harpy.
"
6,4,196,"00:15:30,714","00:15:32,246","We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
"
6,4,197,"00:15:32,349","00:15:35,416","Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.
"
6,4,198,"00:15:36,587","00:15:39,554","I do hope you accept, my friends.
"
6,4,199,"00:15:39,656","00:15:41,523","You will not receive a better offer.
"
6,4,200,"00:15:44,995","00:15:47,829","Let us sail on the tide of freedom
"
6,4,201,"00:15:47,931","00:15:50,164","instead of being drowned by it.
"
6,4,202,"00:15:51,568","00:15:54,636","And as a parting gift to
our honored guests...
"
6,4,203,"00:16:03,614","00:16:05,413","Give freedom a chance.
"
6,4,204,"00:16:05,516","00:16:08,850","See if it doesn't taste every bit

"
6,4,210,"00:16:33,610","00:16:37,078","- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.
"
6,4,211,"00:16:37,180","00:16:38,580","I did.
"
6,4,212,"00:16:38,682","00:16:40,682","Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

6,4,213,"00:16:40,784","00:16:43,919","Now you invite them to our
city and drink wine with them.
"
6,4,214,"00:16:46,623","00:16:50,025","I imagine this room was built
"
6,4,215,"00:16:50,126","00:16:53,161","so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

6,4,221,"00:17:08,244","00:17:11,179","So why do you represent Meereen
in these talks with our enemies?
"
6,4,222,"00:17:11,281","00:17:14,716","Because our queen chose
me as her advisor.
"
6,4,223,"00:17:14,818","00:17:16,918","Until she returns from her travels...
"
6,4,224,"00:17:17,020","00:17:18,519","When does she return?

6,4,225,"00:17:18,622","00:17:21,056","Soon. You have my word.

We know Torgo Nudho.

We trust him.

6,4,372,"00:28:55,351","00:28:59,453","Of course, but for you, that
means seeking out money,
"
6,4,373,"00:28:59,555","00:29:02,423","finery, power.
"
6,4,374,"00:29:02,525","00:29:06,327","Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.
"
6,4,375,"00:29:06,429","00:29:08,329","I'm not maligning you.
"
6,4,376,"00:29:08,431","00:29:11,365","I sought those things out, too.
"
6,4,377,"00:29:11,467","00:29:13,668","To the exclusion of all else.
"
6,4,378,"00:29:15,538","00:29:17,305","My father was a cobbler.
"
6,4,379,"00:29:17,407","00:29:21,575","He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.
"
6,4,380,"00:29:21,678","00:29:24,178","He was a simple man and
he made simple shoes.
"
6,4,381,"00:29:24,280","00:29:27,682","But I found that the more
work I put into my shoes,
"
6,4,382,"00:29:27,784","00:29:28,982","the more people wanted them.
"
6,4,383,"00:29:29,084","00:29:32,152","Fine leather, ornamentation,
"
6,4,384,"00:29:32,254","00:29:36,123","detailing, and time.
"
6,4,385,"00:29:36,225","00:29:37,925","Time most of all.
"
6,4,386,"00:29:38,027","00:29:40,628","Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.
"
6,4,387,"00:29:40,730","00:29:42,463","Quality takes time.
"
6,4,388,"00:29:42,565","00:29:44,498","Yes.
"
6,4,389,"00:29:44,600","00:29:46,667","I imagine you've worn a year
"
6,4,390,"00:29:46,769","00:29:49,737","of someone's life on your back.
"
6,4,391,"00:29:49,839","00:29:52,172","The highborn liked to cover
their feet with my time
"
6,4,392,"00:29:52,274","00:29:55,275","and they paid well for the privilege.
"
6,4,393,"00:29:55,378","00:29:56,944","I used their money
"
6,4,394,"00:29:57,046","00:29:59,780","to buy a taste of their
lives for myself.
"
6,4,395,"00:29:59,882","00:30:02,015","Each time I indulged,
"
6,4,396,"00:30:02,117","00:30:06,220","I felt myself ascending
to something better.
"
6,4,397,"00:30:06,322","00:30:08,322","And one day you walked
through a graveyard
"
6,4,398,"00:30:08,424","00:30:10,123","and realized it was all for nothing
"
6,4,399,"00:30:10,226","00:30:12,760","and set out on the
path to righteousness.
"
6,4,400,"00:30:12,862","00:30:15,463","Book of the Stranger, verse 25.
"
6,4,401,"00:30:15,565","00:30:18,098","You know ""The Seven-Pointed Star.""
"
6,4,402,"00:30:18,200","00:30:20,868","Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
"
6,4,403,"00:30:20,970","00:30:24,805","Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.
"
6,4,404,"00:30:26,509","00:30:27,908","You're close.
"
6,4,405,"00:30:29,044","00:30:31,078","But it wasn't a graveyard.
"
6,4,406,"00:30:31,180","00:30:33,013","It was a feast.
"
6,4,407,"00:30:33,115","00:30:35,383","I bought old fine wine
"
6,4,408,"00:30:35,485","00:30:37,518","and young pretty girls
"
6,4,409,"00:30:37,620","00:30:41,321","and invited my friends to
come and share it all.
"
6,4,410,"00:30:41,424","00:30:44,825","We passed around the wine,
passed around the women,
"
6,4,411,"00:30:44,927","00:30:47,661","and soon we fell into a stupor.
"
6,4,412,"00:30:50,966","00:30:53,734","I woke before dawn.
"
6,4,413,"00:30:53,836","00:30:56,970","I could barely stand.
"
6,4,414,"00:30:57,072","00:31:01,809","Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,
"
6,4,415,"00:31:01,911","00:31:06,547","lying in heaps next to
their fine clothes.
"
6,4,416,"00:31:06,649","00:31:09,082","The truth of their bodies laid bare.
"
6,4,417,"00:31:11,153","00:31:13,987","I could smell them
"
6,4,418,"00:31:14,089","00:31:17,425","beneath the incense and the perfume
"
6,4,419,"00:31:17,527","00:31:21,228","and the fine food that had
already started to turn.
"
6,4,420,"00:31:23,365","00:31:26,567","And I saw it with perfect clarity.
"
6,4,421,"00:31:27,637","00:31:29,970","I saw what my sins were.
"
6,4,422,"00:31:31,474","00:31:34,341","The gold I had, the wine I
drank, the women I used,
"
6,4,423,"00:31:34,444","00:31:38,646","my ceaseless struggle to
maintain my position.
"
6,4,424,"00:31:43,319","00:31:45,586","It was all part of a story.
"
6,4,425,"00:31:47,990","00:31:51,058","A story I was telling
myself about who I was.
"
6,4,426,"00:31:52,061","00:31:53,627","A collection of lies
"
6,4,427,"00:31:53,729","00:31:55,696","that would disappear in the light.
"
6,4,428,"00:31:55,798","00:31:59,700","The people I was trying
to climb away from,
"
6,4,429,"00:31:59,802","00:32:01,268","the beggars in the street,
"
6,4,430,"00:32:01,370","00:32:02,903","the poor,
"
6,4,431,"00:32:03,005","00:32:06,774","they were closer to the
truth than I ever was.
"
6,4,432,"00:32:06,876","00:32:09,409","So what did you do?
"
6,4,433,"00:32:09,512","00:32:11,378","I left to go and find them.
"
6,4,434,"00:32:11,481","00:32:15,082","I didn't even put on my shoes.
"
6,4,435,"00:32:15,184","00:32:19,086","I walked out the door
and never went back.
"
6,4,436,"00:32:24,827","00:32:26,794","Come, let's go and see him.
"
6,4,437,"00:32:27,997","00:32:30,297","- Who?
- Your brother.
"
6,4,438,"00:32:46,382","00:32:47,648","Loras.
"
6,4,439,"00:32:54,089","00:32:56,156","Loras.
"
6,4,440,"00:33:15,044","00:33:16,911","Listen to me.
"
6,4,441,"00:33:17,013","00:33:18,879","You need to stay strong.
"
6,4,442,"00:33:22,317","00:33:24,785","I can't stay strong.
"
6,4,443,"00:33:24,887","00:33:26,654","I never was strong.
"
6,4,444,"00:33:26,756","00:33:28,522","You are strong.
"
6,4,445,"00:33:28,624","00:33:30,958","You are the future of our house,
"
6,4,446,"00:33:31,060","00:33:32,459","the future of our family.
"
6,4,447,"00:33:32,562","00:33:35,128","I don't care about that.
"
6,4,448,"00:33:37,099","00:33:39,366","Have you... have you told them that?
"
6,4,449,"00:33:39,468","00:33:40,935","That you don't care?
"
6,4,450,"00:33:41,037","00:33:45,039","I just want it to stop.
"
6,4,451,"00:33:47,443","00:33:49,276","Help me.
"
6,4,452,"00:33:55,851","00:33:58,619","They want me to help you.
"
6,4,453,"00:33:59,989","00:34:02,723","They want me to help tear you down.
"
6,4,454,"00:34:02,825","00:34:05,793","That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.
"
6,4,455,"00:34:05,895","00:34:09,563","And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.
"
6,4,456,"00:34:09,665","00:34:11,364","Let them win.
"
6,4,457,"00:34:13,302","00:34:14,768","Just make it stop.
"
6,4,458,"00:34:14,870","00:34:17,071","Please.
"
6,4,459,"00:34:19,222","00:34:20,608","All right.
"
6,4,460,"00:34:25,147","00:34:28,983","And now, how to avert disaster
with our current predicament.
"
6,4,461,"00:34:29,085","00:34:31,251","This High Sparrow.
"
6,4,462,"00:34:31,353","00:34:34,321","I have dealt with fanatics of
every description, Your Grace.
"
6,4,463,"00:34:34,423","00:34:38,058","Not setting them off, that's
the most important thing.
"
6,4,464,"00:34:38,160","00:34:41,361","You are beset with enemies
both within and without.
"
6,4,465,"00:34:41,463","00:34:43,130","What are you doing here?
"
6,4,466,"00:34:45,868","00:34:49,269","I am advising the king on
our current predicament.
"
6,4,467,"00:34:49,371","00:34:52,740","- Leave.
- I am a member of the small council.
"
6,4,468,"00:34:52,842","00:34:54,074","The king...
"
6,4,469,"00:34:54,176","00:34:56,810","Is this a small council meeting?
"
6,4,470,"00:34:56,912","00:34:58,178","Obviously not.
"
6,4,471,"00:34:58,280","00:35:01,381","I'm here to lend my
wisdom and my support.
"
6,4,472,"00:35:01,483","00:35:04,718","Thank you for your
counsel, Grand Maester.
"
6,4,473,"00:35:04,820","00:35:06,720","That will be all for now.
"
6,4,474,"00:35:06,822","00:35:08,588","Your Grace.
"
6,4,475,"00:35:32,381","00:35:35,916","Since I've missed the past
several small council meetings,
"
6,4,476,"00:35:36,018","00:35:38,786","I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.
"
6,4,477,"00:35:40,489","00:35:42,790","I've been thinking about
the High Sparrow.
"
6,4,478,"00:35:42,892","00:35:45,559","As have we all, unfortunately.
"
6,4,479,"00:35:45,661","00:35:48,562","We need to be careful in
dealing with such a man.
"
6,4,480,"00:35:50,032","00:35:52,465","To prevent things from
escalating any further.
"
6,4,481,"00:35:54,603","00:35:56,837","We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.
"
6,4,482,"00:35:56,939","00:35:59,339","He has Margaery. We
can't put her at risk.
"
6,4,483,"00:35:59,441","00:36:02,176","- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.
"
6,4,484,"00:36:02,277","00:36:04,111","What did they do to me?
"
6,4,485,"00:36:04,213","00:36:06,146","To the king's own mother?
"
6,4,486,"00:36:10,720","00:36:13,353","It's all right.
"
6,4,487,"00:36:13,455","00:36:15,889","It's done. It's in the past.
"
6,4,488,"00:36:15,991","00:36:18,225","And of course
"
6,4,489,"00:36:18,327","00:36:21,028","Margaery's safety is paramount.
"
6,4,490,"00:36:22,397","00:36:26,266","You don't like Margaery, do you?
"
6,4,491,"00:36:28,003","00:36:31,105","Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.
"
6,4,492,"00:36:33,575","00:36:35,175","Margaery is the queen.
"
6,4,493,"00:36:36,779","00:36:39,880","Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.
"
6,4,494,"00:36:39,982","00:36:42,783","Not just for their own
sake, but for everyone's.
"
6,4,495,"00:36:44,754","00:36:48,188","The High Sparrow has no
respect for kings or queens.
"
6,4,496,"00:36:48,290","00:36:50,124","No respect for anything in this world.
"
6,4,497,"00:36:50,226","00:36:53,127","He has no use for the
things of this world.
"
6,4,498,"00:36:53,229","00:36:56,864","He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?
"
6,4,499,"00:36:56,966","00:36:59,066","With fantasies.
"
6,4,500,"00:36:59,168","00:37:01,168","With beggars in the street.
"
6,4,501,"00:37:01,270","00:37:02,469","With nothing.
"
6,4,502,"00:37:04,473","00:37:06,039","Mother...
"
6,4,503,"00:37:07,676","00:37:09,309","there's something I want to tell you.
"
6,4,504,"00:37:10,780","00:37:13,080","Something the High Sparrow told me.
"
6,4,505,"00:37:15,885","00:37:17,584","You've spoken with him?
"
6,4,506,"00:37:19,554","00:37:22,990","I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told...
"
6,4,507,"00:37:23,092","00:37:25,893","It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly
"
6,4,508,"00:37:25,995","00:37:28,762","given his constant
prattling about the truth.
"
6,4,509,"00:37:31,967","00:37:34,401","I am your mother.
"
6,4,510,"00:37:35,437","00:37:37,470","You can always trust me.
"
6,4,511,"00:37:45,480","00:37:48,882","The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.
"
6,4,512,"00:37:48,984","00:37:51,318","I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.
"
6,4,513,"00:37:51,420","00:37:54,487","- You're not welcome. - You once
spoke of your respect for our father
"
6,4,514,"00:37:54,589","00:37:57,324","because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.
"
6,4,515,"00:37:57,426","00:38:02,262","My dear, you have been stripped
of your dignity and authority,
"
6,4,516,"00:38:02,364","00:38:05,365","publically shamed, and
confined to the Red Keep.
"
6,4,517,"00:38:05,467","00:38:07,701","What's left to work with?
"
6,4,518,"00:38:07,803","00:38:10,204","Cersei is the mother of the king.
"
6,4,519,"00:38:10,306","00:38:13,006","She has the king's ear and his trust.
"
6,4,520,"00:38:13,108","00:38:15,042","And the king has been speaking regularly
"
6,4,521,"00:38:15,144","00:38:18,545","with the High Sparrow about
Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
"
6,4,522,"00:38:18,647","00:38:20,280","The High Sparrow seized power
"
6,4,523,"00:38:20,382","00:38:24,252","knowing full well we'd bicker amongst
ourselves instead of seizing it back.
"
6,4,524,"00:38:24,253","00:38:26,053","Here we are. Well done to us.
"
6,4,525,"00:38:26,155","00:38:28,255","Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms
"
6,4,526,"00:38:28,357","00:38:30,190","rests in his dirty peasant hands.
"
6,4,527,"00:38:30,292","00:38:33,060","In a few days, he'll
have a trial for me.
"
6,4,528,"00:38:33,162","00:38:36,730","But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.
"
6,4,529,"00:38:36,832","00:38:40,433","Yes, Margaery will repent her sins
"
6,4,530,"00:38:40,535","00:38:42,502","before the good people of the city.
"
6,4,531,"00:38:42,604","00:38:45,072","Oh, no.
"
6,4,532,"00:38:45,174","00:38:47,975","That cannot happen.
"
6,4,533,"00:38:48,077","00:38:49,877","That will not happen.
"
6,4,534,"00:38:49,979","00:38:51,644","I agree.
"
6,4,535,"00:38:54,283","00:38:57,184","You've got the second

"
6,4,614,"00:44:41,663","00:44:44,197","Aye. They put me in chains

6,4,615,"00:44:44,299","00:44:46,165","and put a sword at my throat,

6,4,635,"00:46:02,844","00:46:05,144","I had to work hard to get him talking.

6,5,132,"00:11:51,385","00:11:52,284","- You cannot.
- I can.

6,5,133,"00:11:52,386","00:11:53,285","- You will not.
- I will.
"
6,5,134,"00:11:53,387","00:11:55,054","- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

6,5,135,"00:11:55,156","00:11:57,256","<i>- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?</i>
"
6,5,136,"00:11:57,358","00:11:59,124","<i>- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?</i>
"
6,5,137,"00:11:59,227","00:12:01,660","- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?
"
6,5,138,"00:12:13,608","00:12:16,875","So move along, give me my chair
"
6,5,139,"00:12:16,978","00:12:19,078","and there won't be no more trouble.
"
6,5,140,"00:12:22,383","00:12:25,184","But we had a deal
all done and dusted.
"
6,5,141,"00:12:25,286","00:12:28,487","I'm starting to think
you can't be trusted.
"
6,5,142,"00:12:38,966","00:12:40,833","Save my father.
"
6,5,143,"00:12:40,935","00:12:44,370","Truly you should. Killing the
man will do you no good.

what I lack in height,

6,5,160,"00:13:35,756","00:13:37,990","I make up for in appetite.
"
6,5,161,"00:13:38,092","00:13:40,459","<i>So let's forget about your plight,</i>
"
6,5,162,"00:13:40,561","00:13:42,661","and go rehearse our wedding night.
"
6,5,163,"00:13:52,106","00:13:54,873","It's a wart.
Two warts.
"
6,5,164,"00:13:54,975","00:13:56,809","I've got two fucking
warts on my cock.
"
6,5,165,"00:13:56,911","00:14:00,746","Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.
"
6,5,166,"00:14:00,848","00:14:04,116","Oh, wash this, darling.
It stinks of me.
"
6,5,167,"00:14:04,218","00:14:07,453","You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.
"
6,5,168,"00:14:07,555","00:14:09,221","I had two lines.
"
6,5,169,"00:14:09,323","00:14:11,523","There are no small parts.
You rang very false.
"
6,5,170,"00:14:11,625","00:14:13,192","I rang very false?
"
6,5,171,"00:14:13,294","00:14:16,195","What you need, love, is for
someone to ring you true.
"
6,5,172,"00:14:18,099","00:14:20,666","You weren't complaining
about me last night.

some wine, Lady Crane?</i>

"
6,5,175,"00:14:24,972","00:14:27,206","You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.
"
6,5,176,"00:14:27,308","00:14:28,874","Of course we're going to be intimate.
"
6,5,177,"00:14:28,976","00:14:31,543","It's only a matter of time.
"
6,5,178,"00:14:34,248","00:14:36,248","To our children.
"
6,5,179,"00:14:36,350","00:14:38,350","May they have your talent.
"
6,5,180,"00:14:38,452","00:14:40,352","And your filthy mind.
"
6,5,181,"00:14:47,061","00:14:49,461","A girl will poison the rum.
"
6,5,182,"00:14:49,563","00:14:51,797","Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.
"
6,5,183,"00:14:55,803","00:14:58,904","If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

6,5,184,"00:14:59,006","00:15:01,140","A girl is not ready.
"
6,5,185,"00:15:03,611","00:15:06,111","She's a good actress.
"
6,5,186,"00:15:06,213","00:15:08,547","So a man has heard.
"
6,5,187,"00:15:08,649","00:15:11,483","Seems like a decent woman.
"
6,5,188,"00:15:14,488","00:15:17,923","Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?
"
6,5,189,"00:15:20,060","00:15:21,560","No.
"
6,5,190,"00:15:25,299","00:15:26,865","Who wants her dead?
"
6,5,191,"00:15:26,967","00:15:29,768","That does not matter.
The price was paid.
"
6,5,192,"00:15:31,572","00:15:34,540","The younger actress.
"
6,5,193,"00:15:34,642","00:15:37,976","She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.
"
6,5,194,"00:15:38,078","00:15:41,580","A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.
"
6,5,195,"00:15:43,017","00:15:44,750","A girl has decided.
"
6,5,196,"00:15:44,852","00:15:48,487","A servant does not ask questions.
"
6,5,197,"00:16:58,025","00:17:00,425","No! No! No!
"
6,5,198,"00:17:23,517","00:17:25,817","It was you.
"
6,5,199,"00:17:25,920","00:17:27,619","You made the white walkers.
"
6,5,200,"00:17:27,721","00:17:29,855","We were at war.
"
6,5,201,"00:17:29,957","00:17:32,357","<i>We were being slaughtered.</i>
"
6,5,202,"00:17:32,459","00:17:34,893","<i>Our sacred trees cut down.</i>
"
6,5,203,"00:17:34,995","00:17:37,696","We needed to defend ourselves.

"
6,5,205,"00:17:39,400","00:17:41,934","From you.
"
6,5,206,"00:17:42,036","00:17:44,236","From men.
"
6,5,207,"00:17:52,880","00:17:56,582","We speak in the
presence of the Drowned God.

6,5,208,"00:17:56,684","00:17:58,750","In his name we gather today
"
6,5,209,"00:17:58,852","00:18:02,454","to choose a new king as our leader.

Not once.

6,5,218,"00:18:27,848","00:18:31,283","The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

6,5,219,"00:18:31,385","00:18:34,419","until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

"
6,5,221,"00:18:36,256","00:18:38,523","Then they swat us down.

6,5,265,"00:21:36,770","00:21:39,938","and watched him fall.

not killing him years ago.

"
6,5,275,"00:22:04,231","00:22:05,931","That the sort of thing

going to build the Iron Fleet

our pact with the Masters,

out by the Sons of the Harpy?

6,5,370,"00:30:26,833","00:30:28,733","For now is the best we

6,5,372,"00:30:30,437","00:30:32,236","Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

for Meereen to have peace.
"
6,5,375,"00:30:36,609","00:30:39,077","They need to know Daenerys

6,5,457,"00:35:14,087","00:35:17,655","Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?
"
6,5,458,"00:35:27,300","00:35:29,467","We serve the same queen.
"
6,5,459,"00:35:29,569","00:35:31,602","If you are her true friend,
"
6,5,460,"00:35:31,704","00:35:34,338","you have nothing to fear from me.
"
6,5,461,"00:37:24,283","00:37:25,816","What?
"
6,5,462,"00:39:09,589","00:39:11,589","He saw me, the Night King!
"
6,5,463,"00:39:11,691","00:39:13,858","- <i>He saw me!</i>
- He touched you.
"
6,5,464,"00:39:15,394","00:39:17,528","I don't know.
He was close, but--
"
6,5,465,"00:39:17,630","00:39:18,630","He touched you.
"
6,5,466,"00:39:21,934","00:39:23,968","He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.
"
6,5,467,"00:39:24,070","00:39:25,469","But he can't get in.
"
6,5,468,"00:39:25,571","00:39:29,106","He can now.
His mark is on you.
"
6,5,469,"00:39:29,208","00:39:31,175","You must leave, all of you.
"
6,5,470,"00:39:35,214","00:39:37,147","<i>Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.</i>
"
6,5,471,"00:39:37,250","00:39:39,049","Hodor.
"
6,5,472,"00:39:39,151","00:39:41,118","I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
"
6,5,473,"00:39:41,220","00:39:44,121","- The time has come.
- The time for what?
"
6,5,474,"00:39:44,223","00:39:47,258","For you to become me.
"
6,5,475,"00:39:47,360","00:39:51,462","But am I ready?
"
6,5,476,"00:39:51,564","00:39:53,464","No.
"
6,5,477,"00:39:55,401","00:39:58,135","We can't defend the north
from the walkers
"
6,5,478,"00:39:58,237","00:39:59,970","and the south from the Boltons.
"
6,5,479,"00:40:00,072","00:40:02,006","If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell
"
6,5,480,"00:40:02,108","00:40:04,909","and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.
"
6,5,481,"00:40:08,114","00:40:10,781","<i>Aside from the
Starks and the Boltons,</i>
"
6,5,482,"00:40:10,883","00:40:13,584","the most powerful houses in the North
"
6,5,483,"00:40:13,686","00:40:15,719","are the Umbers, the Karstarks,
"
6,5,484,"00:40:15,821","00:40:17,454","and the Manderlys.
"
6,5,485,"00:40:17,556","00:40:20,257","The Umbers and the Karstarks
"
6,5,486,"00:40:20,359","00:40:22,293","have already declared
for the Boltons,
"
6,5,487,"00:40:22,395","00:40:24,028","so we're not doing so well there.
"
6,5,488,"00:40:24,130","00:40:26,764","The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.
"
6,5,489,"00:40:26,866","00:40:29,099","But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
"
6,5,490,"00:40:29,201","00:40:31,702","without knowing
they had another choice.
"
6,5,491,"00:40:31,804","00:40:34,138","I beg your pardon, my lady,
"
6,5,492,"00:40:34,240","00:40:37,374","but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.
"
6,5,493,"00:40:37,476","00:40:39,510","I don't think we can
count on them either.
"
6,5,494,"00:40:41,180","00:40:43,881","How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?
"
6,5,495,"00:40:43,983","00:40:45,349","Precious little, my lady.
"
6,5,496,"00:40:45,451","00:40:47,584","<i>My father always said
Northerners are different.</i>
"
6,5,497,"00:40:47,687","00:40:51,388","More loyal, more
suspicious of outsiders.
"
6,5,498,"00:40:51,490","00:40:53,057","They may well be loyal,
"
6,5,499,"00:40:53,159","00:40:55,125","but how many rose up
against the Boltons
"
6,5,500,"00:40:55,227","00:40:56,994","when they betrayed your family?
"
6,5,501,"00:40:59,332","00:41:01,932","I may not know the North,
but I know men.
"
6,5,502,"00:41:02,034","00:41:04,535","They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world
"
6,5,503,"00:41:04,637","00:41:07,538","and even the bravest of
them don't want to see
"
6,5,504,"00:41:07,640","00:41:10,941","their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.
"
6,5,505,"00:41:11,043","00:41:14,378","If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,
"
6,5,506,"00:41:14,480","00:41:16,447","they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.
"
6,5,507,"00:41:16,549","00:41:19,116","There are more than three
other houses in the North--
"
6,5,508,"00:41:19,218","00:41:21,852","Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,
"
6,5,509,"00:41:21,954","00:41:23,554","<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>
"
6,5,510,"00:41:23,656","00:41:27,257","Two dozen more. Together
they equal all the others.
"
6,5,511,"00:41:27,360","00:41:29,326","We can start small and build.
"
6,5,512,"00:41:29,428","00:41:31,862","<i>The North remembers.</i>
"
6,5,513,"00:41:31,964","00:41:33,430","<i>They remember the Stark name.</i>
"
6,5,514,"00:41:33,532","00:41:35,432","People will still risk
everything for it,
"
6,5,515,"00:41:35,534","00:41:37,735","from White Harbor
to Ramsay's own door.
"
6,5,516,"00:41:37,837","00:41:40,037","I don't doubt it.
"
6,5,517,"00:41:40,139","00:41:42,239","But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
"
6,5,518,"00:41:42,341","00:41:44,408","No, but I do.
"
6,5,519,"00:41:47,313","00:41:49,947","Jon is every bit
as much Ned Stark's son
"
6,5,520,"00:41:50,049","00:41:51,849","as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.
"
6,5,521,"00:41:51,951","00:41:53,991","<i>And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,</i>
"
6,5,522,"00:41:54,086","00:41:57,054","<i>but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.</i>
"
6,5,523,"00:41:57,156","00:41:58,689","I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.
"
6,5,524,"00:41:58,791","00:42:00,724","My uncle the Blackfish
has reformed it
"
6,5,525,"00:42:00,826","00:42:02,059","and retaken Riverrun.
"
6,5,526,"00:42:02,161","00:42:04,228","How do you know that?
"
6,5,527,"00:42:05,598","00:42:08,599","Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.
"
6,5,528,"00:42:10,636","00:42:12,369","That's good.
"
6,5,529,"00:42:12,471","00:42:14,471","The Blackfish is a legend.
"
6,5,530,"00:42:14,573","00:42:16,974","His support would mean a great deal.
"
6,5,531,"00:42:17,076","00:42:20,077","Stark, Tully, a few more houses,
"
6,5,532,"00:42:20,179","00:42:22,413","almost starts to look
like a winning side.
"
6,5,533,"00:42:24,817","00:42:26,884","I've sworn to protect you, my lady.
"
6,5,534,"00:42:26,986","00:42:28,752","You heard them.
We need more men
"
6,5,535,"00:42:28,854","00:42:30,654","and my uncle has an army.
"
6,5,536,"00:42:30,756","00:42:32,289","We can send the Blackfish a raven.
"
6,5,537,"00:42:32,391","00:42:34,425","Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
"
6,5,538,"00:42:34,527","00:42:36,193","It has to be you.
"
6,5,539,"00:42:36,295","00:42:38,562","Ride for Riverrun.
My uncle will talk to you
"
6,5,540,"00:42:38,664","00:42:40,464","and you'll know how to talk to him.
"
6,5,541,"00:42:42,802","00:42:44,234","What is it?
"
6,5,542,"00:42:46,038","00:42:48,072","I don't like leaving you here alone.
"
6,5,543,"00:42:48,174","00:42:49,473","With Jon?
"
6,5,544,"00:42:49,575","00:42:52,342","Not him.
He seems trustworthy.
"
6,5,545,"00:42:52,445","00:42:54,445","A bit brooding, perhaps.
"
6,5,546,"00:42:54,547","00:42:56,613","I suppose that's
understandable, considering.
"
6,5,547,"00:42:58,350","00:43:00,217","The others, though.
"
6,5,548,"00:43:02,388","00:43:06,023","Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother
"
6,5,549,"00:43:06,125","00:43:07,724","with bloodmagic.
"
6,5,550,"00:43:07,827","00:43:10,427","<i>And when Stannis paid for

leader with better prospects.
"
6,5,552,"00:43:14,834","00:43:17,267","And that wildling fellow
with the beard--
"
6,5,553,"00:43:17,369","00:43:20,604","Jon isn't Tormund. Jon
isn't Davos, the Red Woman
"
6,5,554,"00:43:20,706","00:43:23,707","or Stannis for that matter.
Jon is Jon.
"
6,5,555,"00:43:23,809","00:43:27,277","He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.
"
6,5,556,"00:43:29,748","00:43:33,684","Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?
"
6,5,557,"00:43:42,895","00:43:44,561","New dress?
"
6,5,558,"00:43:44,663","00:43:47,397","I made it myself.
Do you like it?

"
6,5,560,"00:43:51,604","00:43:55,706","Good, because I made this for you.

"
6,6,15,"00:06:02,596","00:06:04,396","Once you get south of the Riverlands,
"
6,6,16,"00:06:04,498","00:06:07,399","very different sorts of
trees start to take over.
"

autumn colors coming in.
"

here than anywhere else.

6,6,22,"00:06:28,756","00:06:32,424","You're nervous.
You're a nervous talker.
"
6,6,23,"00:06:37,231","00:06:39,631","That's not any better
being a nervous mute.
"
6,6,24,"00:06:39,733","00:06:42,201","I didn't think
I'd ever come back here
"
6,6,25,"00:06:42,303","00:06:44,570","after my father made me
renounce my title
"
6,6,26,"00:06:44,672","00:06:46,538","and inheritance
"
6,6,27,"00:06:46,640","00:06:49,074","and, well, threaten
to kill me if I didn't.
"
6,6,28,"00:06:50,644","00:06:53,011","A person just doesn't
feel welcome at that point.
"
6,6,29,"00:06:55,082","00:06:58,317","And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.
"
6,6,30,"00:06:59,787","00:07:02,254","So you know what to tell them.
"
6,6,31,"00:07:02,356","00:07:04,223","That Little Sam is your baby.
"
6,6,32,"00:07:04,325","00:07:05,891","Yes, now that's very important.
"
6,6,33,"00:07:05,993","00:07:08,493","If he thinks that
Little Sam is his grandchild,
"
6,6,34,"00:07:08,596","00:07:10,462","he'll take you in.
"
6,6,35,"00:07:10,564","00:07:13,966","He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.
"
6,6,36,"00:07:14,068","00:07:16,969","And you can help teach him. Huh?
"
6,6,37,"00:07:17,071","00:07:20,005","What did you tell
your family about me?
"
6,6,38,"00:07:23,477","00:07:25,878","I told them I met you in the North.
"
6,6,39,"00:07:25,980","00:07:27,846","Did you tell them how far north?
"
6,6,40,"00:07:27,948","00:07:31,049","Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.
"
6,6,41,"00:07:31,151","00:07:32,831","You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?
"
6,6,42,"00:07:32,920","00:07:34,720","You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
"
6,6,43,"00:07:34,822","00:07:36,922","The thing is...
"
6,6,44,"00:07:37,024","00:07:39,358","my father doesn't like wildlings.
"
6,6,45,"00:07:39,460","00:07:43,829","He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by ""killing some bloody wildlings,""
"
6,6,46,"00:07:43,931","00:07:47,499","so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.
"
6,6,47,"00:07:50,371","00:07:52,738","I think we're here.
"
6,6,48,"00:08:22,236","00:08:23,502","Sam.
"
6,6,49,"00:08:23,604","00:08:25,837","Oh, Sam.
"
6,6,50,"00:08:25,940","00:08:28,073","Oh, hello, Mother.
"
6,6,51,"00:08:30,778","00:08:32,744","I never thought I'd see you again.
"
6,6,52,"00:08:32,846","00:08:35,447","- You look wonderful.
- Oh.
"
6,6,53,"00:08:38,352","00:08:39,685","Talla?
"
6,6,54,"00:08:39,787","00:08:42,554","Gods, you're a woman now.
"
6,6,55,"00:08:42,656","00:08:45,123","Father says I have
to marry Symun Fossoway.
"
6,6,56,"00:08:45,225","00:08:48,260","- He has yellow teeth--
- That's enough, Talla.
"
6,6,57,"00:08:50,297","00:08:54,633","Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.
"
6,6,58,"00:08:56,904","00:08:59,171","Oh, my.

6,6,59,"00:08:59,273","00:09:01,373","You are lovely.
"
6,6,60,"00:09:03,344","00:09:05,877","I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.
"
6,6,61,"00:09:09,183","00:09:12,050","Oh, and this,
"
6,6,62,"00:09:12,152","00:09:14,553","this is our son Samwell.
"
6,6,63,"00:09:19,393","00:09:22,594","Hello, little one.
"
6,6,64,"00:09:22,696","00:09:26,064","It's me, your grandmother.
"
6,6,65,"00:09:27,835","00:09:29,267","May I hold him?
"
6,6,66,"00:09:29,370","00:09:31,269","Yes, of course.
"
6,6,67,"00:09:35,309","00:09:37,175","Oh.
"
6,6,68,"00:09:37,277","00:09:39,711","You have a curious mind, I can tell.
"
6,6,69,"00:09:39,813","00:09:43,081","You'll be a scholar like your father.
"
6,6,70,"00:09:43,183","00:09:47,219","Where is Father?
And Dickon?
"
6,6,71,"00:09:47,321","00:09:49,154","They're on a hunt.
"
6,6,72,"00:09:50,357","00:09:52,391","<i>They'll join us for dinner.</i>
"
6,6,73,"00:09:52,493","00:09:55,827","Come inside.
Such a journey.
"
6,6,74,"00:09:55,929","00:09:57,629","You must be exhausted.
"
6,6,75,"00:09:57,731","00:10:01,099","Come, you'll be wanting a
bath after all that travel.
"
6,6,76,"00:10:01,201","00:10:03,301","Oh, and a dress for dinner.
"
6,6,77,"00:10:03,404","00:10:05,070","You can wear one of mine.
"
6,6,78,"00:10:05,172","00:10:07,005","What's your color?
"
6,6,79,"00:10:07,107","00:10:09,474","Midnight blue or silver?
"
6,6,80,"00:10:09,576","00:10:11,676","Silver, maybe.
Come.
"
6,6,81,"00:10:11,779","00:10:14,146","You can choose one of my
bedrooms if you want.
"
6,6,82,"00:10:23,157","00:10:25,690","Is there no other way?
"
6,6,83,"00:10:25,793","00:10:27,359","You're afraid for her?
"
6,6,84,"00:10:27,461","00:10:30,228","Of course I'm afraid for her!
"
6,6,85,"00:10:32,800","00:10:36,401","It just seems very dangerous.
"
6,6,86,"00:10:36,503","00:10:38,937","She'll be protected the entire way.
"
6,6,87,"00:10:39,039","00:10:41,606","The Faith Militant are very stern
"
6,6,88,"00:10:41,708","00:10:44,309","with those who overstep their bounds.
"
6,6,89,"00:10:46,146","00:10:49,714","And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.
"
6,6,90,"00:10:49,817","00:10:52,751","I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people
"
6,6,91,"00:10:52,853","00:10:55,387","to gentleness on her behalf.
"
6,6,92,"00:10:55,489","00:10:57,956","She's truly opened her heart to them.
"
6,6,93,"00:10:58,058","00:11:01,827","She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.
"
6,6,94,"00:11:01,929","00:11:04,763","And now she's devoted
to the gods as well.
"
6,6,95,"00:11:06,967","00:11:09,201","Would you like to see her?
"
6,6,96,"00:11:30,557","00:11:32,290","Have they hurt you?
"
6,6,97,"00:11:32,392","00:11:33,792","Have they mistreated you?
"
6,6,98,"00:11:33,894","00:11:36,962","- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.
"
6,6,99,"00:11:37,064","00:11:38,763","More than you could know.
"
6,6,100,"00:11:38,866","00:11:41,032","We'll be together again soon
"
6,6,101,"00:11:41,135","00:11:43,869","and everything will be
better than it was before.
"
6,6,102,"00:11:43,971","00:11:45,904","Better how?
"
6,6,103,"00:11:46,006","00:11:47,372","Soon the--
"
6,6,104,"00:11:49,843","00:11:51,643","walk of atonement.
"
6,6,105,"00:11:53,147","00:11:55,280","He says there's no other way.
"
6,6,106,"00:11:55,382","00:11:58,483","Have you spoken to him at
all, the High Sparrow?
"
6,6,107,"00:11:58,585","00:12:01,953","Yes, a few times.
"
6,6,108,"00:12:02,055","00:12:03,388","Have you?
"
6,6,109,"00:12:03,490","00:12:04,990","Yes, I have.
"
6,6,110,"00:12:05,092","00:12:07,759","He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?
"
6,6,111,"00:12:09,296","00:12:12,030","You think I'm mad.
"
6,6,112,"00:12:12,132","00:12:14,199","I sound mad.
"
6,6,113,"00:12:14,301","00:12:16,234","No.
No, you don't.
"
6,6,114,"00:12:16,336","00:12:18,370","You--
you could never.
"
6,6,115,"00:12:18,472","00:12:20,138","You're right, he's not.
"
6,6,116,"00:12:20,240","00:12:21,940","He's a lot more--
"
6,6,117,"00:12:22,042","00:12:23,575","He is.
"
6,6,118,"00:12:23,677","00:12:25,777","There's something about him.
"
6,6,119,"00:12:25,879","00:12:27,946","His way of looking at the world.
"
6,6,120,"00:12:30,317","00:12:35,487","It's not an easy thing admitting
to yourself what you really are.
"
6,6,121,"00:12:35,589","00:12:37,522","It's taken me a while.
"
6,6,122,"00:12:37,624","00:12:39,658","He's helped me.
"
6,6,123,"00:12:39,760","00:12:41,660","What are you talking about?
"
6,6,124,"00:12:41,762","00:12:46,097","You're a good person. You've
always been a good person.
"
6,6,125,"00:12:46,200","00:12:49,367","You're the best person I know.
"
6,6,126,"00:12:49,469","00:12:52,470","I was just telling him about
your devotion to the poor.
"
6,6,127,"00:12:52,573","00:12:54,372","Ah, yes, I visited their hovels
"
6,6,128,"00:12:54,474","00:12:57,876","and I fed them soup and I made
sure I was seen doing it.
"
6,6,129,"00:12:59,313","00:13:02,681","I never gave them what
they really needed, though.
"
6,6,130,"00:13:02,783","00:13:07,452","I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.
"
6,6,131,"00:13:09,056","00:13:11,656","All those stories I told
myself about who I was
"
6,6,132,"00:13:11,758","00:13:14,392","and why I did the things I did.
"
6,6,133,"00:13:15,629","00:13:18,296","There were so many lies
in those stories.
"
6,6,134,"00:13:20,100","00:13:21,800","I don't understand.
"
6,6,135,"00:13:21,902","00:13:24,069","It's all right.
It really is.
"
6,6,136,"00:13:24,171","00:13:27,639","It's such a relief
to let go of those lies.
"
6,6,137,"00:13:32,713","00:13:34,579","What about Loras?
"

"
6,6,139,"00:13:38,218","00:13:42,053","I will always love my brother.
"
6,6,140,"00:13:42,155","00:13:46,458","His soul is pure and perfect.
"
6,6,141,"00:13:46,560","00:13:49,060","His sins don't erase that purity,
"
6,6,142,"00:13:49,162","00:13:51,196","they only obscure it.
"
6,6,143,"00:13:51,298","00:13:55,700","He just needs to atone for them.
"
6,6,144,"00:13:56,937","00:13:58,236","We all do.
"
6,6,145,"00:13:58,338","00:14:01,539","Sooner or later, one way or another.
"
6,6,146,"00:14:02,876","00:14:05,910","The gods have a plan for us all.
"
6,6,147,"00:14:21,261","00:14:24,095","It's hard to walk in this.
"
6,6,148,"00:14:26,300","00:14:28,199","It's beautiful.
"
6,6,149,"00:14:30,070","00:14:31,870","You're beautiful.
"
6,6,150,"00:15:19,052","00:15:22,921","This venison, it's very tasty.
"
6,6,151,"00:15:23,023","00:15:25,557","Is it from today's hunt?
"
6,6,152,"00:15:25,659","00:15:27,559","Well, no.
"
6,6,153,"00:15:27,661","00:15:29,594","We haven't been able

"
6,6,155,"00:15:31,698","00:15:35,233","Oh, of course.
Sorry.
"
6,6,156,"00:15:35,335","00:15:37,302","Long journey.
"
6,6,157,"00:15:37,404","00:15:39,904","Brought it down from 70 yards.
"
6,6,158,"00:15:40,006","00:15:41,606","One shot.
"
6,6,159,"00:15:41,708","00:15:45,143","Oh, that's a fair distance.
"
6,6,160,"00:15:45,245","00:15:48,113","So do you do much hunting
up at the Wall?
"
6,6,161,"00:15:48,215","00:15:50,882","Oh, yes.
Yes.
"
6,6,162,"00:15:50,984","00:15:52,550","A good amount.
"
6,6,163,"00:15:53,720","00:15:55,286","North of the Wall,
"
6,6,164,"00:15:55,389","00:15:57,522","you don't hunt, you don't eat.

"
6,6,166,"00:15:59,192","00:16:01,059","Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

6,6,167,"00:16:02,562","00:16:04,763","Rabbits.

"
6,6,172,"00:16:17,911","00:16:20,879","She's-- she's quite

"
6,6,173,"00:16:21,915","00:16:24,215","Um, huntress.

6,6,174,"00:16:24,317","00:16:26,518","<i>I imagine it's

"
6,6,175,"00:16:26,620","00:16:30,054","We once met a man, Lord Umber from
Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

6,6,176,"00:16:30,157","00:16:32,390","<i>who said he taught all

"
6,6,178,"00:16:35,095","00:16:36,928","Our father would never teach us.
"
6,6,179,"00:16:37,030","00:16:41,032","I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.
"
6,6,180,"00:16:41,134","00:16:42,434","That's enough of that.
"
6,6,181,"00:16:45,906","00:16:47,472","Samwell, would you care
for more bread?
"
6,6,182,"00:16:47,574","00:16:50,542","Oh, yes.

"
6,6,183,"00:16:50,644","00:16:52,210","Thank you, Mother.
"
6,6,184,"00:16:56,316","00:16:58,450","Not fat enough already?
"
6,6,185,"00:17:10,397","00:17:13,231","I travelled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.
"
6,6,186,"00:17:13,333","00:17:15,567","- He wants me to--

6,6,191,"00:17:25,378","00:17:28,580","I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.
"
6,6,192,"00:17:30,183","00:17:32,383","Something resembling a man at least.
"
6,6,193,"00:17:33,787","00:17:37,322","You managed to stay soft and fat.

6,6,196,"00:17:46,466","00:17:49,934","I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

Night's Watch is a great honor.
"
6,6,198,"00:17:53,240","00:17:55,573","He can wield a sword.
"
6,6,199,"00:17:56,943","00:17:59,010","He killed a Thenn.
"
6,6,200,"00:18:00,847","00:18:02,247","He killed a white walker.

6,6,201,"00:18:02,349","00:18:05,750","There's no such thing.
"
6,6,202,"00:18:07,521","00:18:10,889","I saw it with my own eyes on
our way down to Castle Black.
"
6,6,203,"00:18:10,991","00:18:14,626","He drove a dagger
into the walker's heart.
"
6,6,204,"00:18:14,728","00:18:18,229","He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

6,6,205,"00:18:18,331","00:18:21,933","He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

6,6,219,"00:19:22,762","00:19:26,464","It's been in our family

6,6,224,"00:19:38,178","00:19:41,579","He will never wield that sword.

Riverrun is ours.
"
6,6,477,"00:39:58,230","00:40:00,564","Take it back.

"
6,6,516,"00:42:03,188","00:42:06,556","I'll take them to the sept and I'll

you won't leave the sept alive.

"
6,6,541,"00:43:49,528","00:43:51,027","The Three-Eyed Raven

6,6,551,"00:44:45,884","00:44:48,451","I led a ranging party
deep into the North

6,6,552,"00:44:48,553","00:44:51,287","to find white walkers.
"
6,6,553,"00:44:51,389","00:44:52,989","They found us.
"
6,6,554,"00:44:53,091","00:44:56,926","A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.
"
6,6,555,"00:44:59,264","00:45:00,930","Left me there to die.
"
6,6,556,"00:45:01,032","00:45:02,432","To turn.
"
6,6,557,"00:45:02,534","00:45:05,101","The Children found me.

"
6,6,560,"00:45:09,908","00:45:12,208","The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

6,6,562,"00:45:15,447","00:45:17,447","Dragonglass.

same fucking thing.
"
6,7,42,"00:06:08,046","00:06:09,646","I don't know.

6,7,43,"00:06:09,748","00:06:11,748","What matters, I believe,
"
6,7,44,"00:06:11,850","00:06:14,851","is that there's something
greater than us.

6,7,45,"00:06:14,953","00:06:19,789","And whatever it is, it's got
plans for Sandor Clegane.

bones just like Mance.

6,7,154,"00:12:48,914","00:12:51,414","And if we lose this, we're gone.
"
6,7,155,"00:12:51,516","00:12:55,985","Dozens of tribes,
hundreds of generations.

collapse because of you

"
6,7,189,"00:15:54,199","00:15:56,132","I made a terrible mistake.

6,7,191,"00:15:58,103","00:15:59,602","Good.
"
6,7,192,"00:15:59,704","00:16:03,239","I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

6,7,194,"00:16:07,779","00:16:09,879","We need each other.

6,7,197,"00:16:18,289","00:16:22,892","But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

way you smirked at me

6,7,199,"00:16:25,263","00:16:29,098","when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?
"
6,7,200,"00:16:29,200","00:16:31,968","I do. I'll never forget it.

city as fast as I can

6,7,206,"00:16:45,950","00:16:50,019","before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.
"
6,7,207,"00:16:50,121","00:16:52,088","If you're half as bright
as you think you are,
"
6,7,208,"00:16:52,190","00:16:53,856","you'll find a way out of here, too.
"
6,7,209,"00:16:53,958","00:16:55,557","Never.
"
6,7,210,"00:16:55,660","00:16:57,059","I'll never leave my son.
"
6,7,211,"00:16:57,162","00:16:59,128","What'll you do, then?
"
6,7,212,"00:16:59,230","00:17:02,131","You have no support. Not anymore.
"
6,7,213,"00:17:02,233","00:17:05,301","Your brother's gone. The
High Sparrow saw to that.
"
6,7,214,"00:17:05,403","00:17:08,337","The rest of your family
have abandoned you.
"
6,7,215,"00:17:08,439","00:17:10,306","The people despise you.
"
6,7,216,"00:17:10,408","00:17:12,875","You're surrounded by
enemies, thousands of them.
"
6,7,217,"00:17:12,977","00:17:14,944","You're going to kill
them all by yourself?
"
6,7,218,"00:17:16,414","00:17:18,014","You've lost, Cersei.
"
6,7,219,"00:17:18,116","00:17:22,151","It's the only joy I can
find in all this misery.
"
6,7,220,"00:17:29,760","00:17:32,195","Pick the pace up.
"
6,7,221,"00:17:32,297","00:17:33,762","Keep going.
"
6,7,222,"00:17:37,668","00:17:39,836","Keep it moving!
"
6,7,223,"00:18:15,539","00:18:17,806","Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.
"
6,7,224,"00:18:17,909","00:18:21,543","Someone needs to teach those
sad twats how to dig trenches.
"
6,7,225,"00:18:21,645","00:18:24,513","Someone certainly does.
"
6,7,226,"00:18:24,615","00:18:27,250","Oh, no. Not me.
"
6,7,227,"00:18:27,352","00:18:28,885","I'm just an upjumped sellsword.
"
6,7,228,"00:18:28,987","00:18:31,754","You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.
"
6,7,229,"00:18:31,856","00:18:33,689","Aye, knights don't get paid.
"
6,7,230,"00:18:33,791","00:18:37,393","You have better instincts than any
officer in the Lannister army.
"
6,7,231,"00:18:37,495","00:18:41,563","That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.
"
6,7,232,"00:18:43,101","00:18:46,735","I expect to command all the
Lannister forces before long.
"
6,7,233,"00:18:46,837","00:18:48,871","You can be the right hand I lost.
"
6,7,234,"00:18:52,610","00:18:55,511","You promised me a lordship and a castle
"
6,7,235,"00:18:55,613","00:18:57,579","and a highborn beauty for a wife.
"
6,7,236,"00:18:57,681","00:19:00,182","And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always...
"
6,7,237,"00:19:00,285","00:19:03,386","Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
"
6,7,238,"00:19:21,205","00:19:25,374","Come out and fight us, Blackfish.
"
6,7,239,"00:19:25,476","00:19:27,310","We have Lord Edmure.
"
6,7,240,"00:19:28,980","00:19:31,981","Yield the castle or we'll hang him.
"
6,7,241,"00:19:50,901","00:19:53,535","This is your last warning.
"
6,7,242,"00:19:53,637","00:19:55,504","Yield the castle.
"
6,7,243,"00:20:07,485","00:20:09,751","You think I won't do it, old man?
"
6,7,244,"00:20:12,756","00:20:15,257","I sliced your niece's
throat from ear to ear.
"
6,7,245,"00:20:15,360","00:20:19,295","And where were you? Running and
hiding like a fucking coward.
"
6,7,246,"00:20:21,599","00:20:25,934","Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
"
6,7,247,"00:20:35,746","00:20:38,714","Go on, then. Cut his throat.
"
6,7,248,"00:21:00,471","00:21:02,971","Lothar, is it?
"
6,7,249,"00:21:03,074","00:21:05,274","Ser Jaime.
"
6,7,250,"00:21:05,376","00:21:06,942","We didn't know you were coming.
"
6,7,251,"00:21:07,045","00:21:08,710","'Cause you didn't set
a proper perimeter.
"
6,7,252,"00:21:08,812","00:21:11,647","You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.
"
6,7,253,"00:21:11,749","00:21:15,551","Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.
"
6,7,254,"00:21:15,653","00:21:17,553","Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
"
6,7,255,"00:21:19,823","00:21:21,257","Walder.
"
6,7,256,"00:21:23,361","00:21:26,562","Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
"
6,7,257,"00:21:28,466","00:21:32,068","Only a fool makes threats he's
not prepared to carry out.
"
6,7,258,"00:21:32,170","00:21:34,937","Now let's say I threatened to hit you
"
6,7,259,"00:21:35,039","00:21:37,606","unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.
"
6,7,260,"00:21:37,708","00:21:40,176","- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's...
"
6,7,261,"00:21:42,580","00:21:44,947","I'm here by the king's command
to take back this castle.
"
6,7,262,"00:21:45,049","00:21:47,683","Have him bathed and fed.
"
6,7,263,"00:21:47,785","00:21:50,352","Unless you'd like to take his place.
"
6,7,264,"00:21:51,689","00:21:53,289","Apologies, Ser Jaime.
"
6,7,265,"00:21:53,391","00:21:54,690","Do as he says.
"
6,7,266,"00:21:54,792","00:21:57,193","The siege is now under my command.
"
6,7,267,"00:21:57,295","00:21:59,895","The next time the Blackfish
looks out from those ramparts,
"
6,7,268,"00:21:59,997","00:22:03,031","he'll see an army at his
gates, not whatever this is.
"
6,7,269,"00:22:03,134","00:22:05,301","Have your lads start digging
perimeter trenches.
"
6,7,270,"00:22:05,403","00:22:06,902","Set pickets every hundred yards.
"
6,7,271,"00:22:07,004","00:22:09,538","And work double-time on those
siege towers and trebuchets.
"
6,7,272,"00:22:09,640","00:22:10,973","Those are our siege towers...
"
6,7,273,"00:22:11,075","00:22:13,542","As I said, the siege
is under my command.
"
6,7,274,"00:22:13,644","00:22:16,212","If that's not to your liking, go home.
"
6,7,275,"00:22:22,320","00:22:24,520","Get word to the Blackfish.
"
6,7,276,"00:22:24,622","00:22:26,489","I want a parley.
"
6,7,277,"00:22:26,591","00:22:28,491","A parley or a fight?
"
6,7,278,"00:22:29,627","00:22:31,527","He's an old man.
"
6,7,279,"00:22:31,629","00:22:33,395","You've got one hand.
"
6,7,280,"00:22:33,498","00:22:35,598","My money's on the old boy.
"
6,7,281,"00:22:55,085","00:22:57,452","Lady Mormont.
"
6,7,282,"00:22:57,520","00:22:59,821","Welcome to Bear Island.
"
6,7,283,"00:23:06,964","00:23:09,131","I remember when you were born, my lady.
"
6,7,284,"00:23:09,233","00:23:10,966","You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.
"
6,7,285,"00:23:11,068","00:23:13,802","It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.
"
6,7,286,"00:23:13,904","00:23:16,238","I doubt it. My mother
wasn't a great beauty
"
6,7,287,"00:23:16,340","00:23:17,606","or any other kind of beauty.
"
6,7,288,"00:23:17,708","00:23:19,875","She was a great warrior, though.
"
6,7,289,"00:23:19,977","00:23:22,311","She died fighting for your brother Robb.
"
6,7,290,"00:23:25,650","00:23:29,151","I served under your uncle at
Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.
"
6,7,291,"00:23:29,253","00:23:32,321","He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.
"
6,7,292,"00:23:32,423","00:23:34,056","I was his steward. In fact...
"
6,7,293,"00:23:34,158","00:23:37,326","I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?
"
6,7,294,"00:23:39,730","00:23:42,498","Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black
"
6,7,295,"00:23:42,600","00:23:45,100","before he marched on
Winterfell and was killed.
"
6,7,296,"00:23:45,203","00:23:48,003","He showed me the letter you wrote
to him when he petitioned for men.
"
6,7,297,"00:23:48,105","00:23:50,005","- It said...
- I remember what it said.
"
6,7,298,"00:23:50,107","00:23:51,607","Bear Island knows no king
"
6,7,299,"00:23:51,709","00:23:54,376","but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.
"
6,7,300,"00:23:56,914","00:23:58,847","Robb is gone,
"
6,7,301,"00:23:58,949","00:24:00,482","but House Stark is not.
"
6,7,302,"00:24:00,585","00:24:03,752","And it needs your support
now more than ever.
"
6,7,303,"00:24:03,854","00:24:07,923","I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.
"
6,7,304,"00:24:19,036","00:24:21,002","As far as I understand, you're a Snow
"
6,7,305,"00:24:21,105","00:24:22,904","and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.
"
6,7,306,"00:24:23,006","00:24:25,073","Or is she a Lannister?
"
6,7,307,"00:24:25,175","00:24:27,443","I've heard conflicting reports.
"
6,7,308,"00:24:27,545","00:24:30,512","I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.
"
6,7,309,"00:24:30,615","00:24:33,382","But I am a Stark. I
will always be a Stark.
"
6,7,310,"00:24:33,484","00:24:35,984","If you say so. In any case,
"
6,7,311,"00:24:36,086","00:24:38,954","you don't just want my allegiance.
You want my fighting men.
"
6,7,312,"00:24:39,056","00:24:41,957","Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.
"
6,7,313,"00:24:42,059","00:24:43,825","It is our duty to stop him.
"
6,7,314,"00:24:43,927","00:24:48,230","Even more so because he holds our
brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.
"
6,7,315,"00:24:50,568","00:24:52,468","What you have to understand,
my lady, is that...
"
6,7,316,"00:24:52,570","00:24:56,405","I understand that I'm responsible for
Bear Island and all who live here.
"
6,7,317,"00:24:56,507","00:25:01,042","So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?
"
6,7,318,"00:25:06,884","00:25:10,152","If it please, my lady,
"
6,7,319,"00:25:10,254","00:25:11,853","I understand how you feel.
"
6,7,320,"00:25:11,955","00:25:14,390","I don't know you, Ser...?
"
6,7,321,"00:25:14,492","00:25:16,492","Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.
"
6,7,322,"00:25:16,594","00:25:19,194","You needn't ask your
maester about my house.
"
6,7,323,"00:25:19,297","00:25:21,630","It's rather new.
"
6,7,324,"00:25:23,133","00:25:25,701","All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.
"
6,7,325,"00:25:25,803","00:25:27,770","How is it you understand how I feel?
"
6,7,326,"00:25:28,668","00:25:32,608","You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.
"
6,7,327,"00:25:32,710","00:25:36,244","Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.
"
6,7,328,"00:25:36,347","00:25:38,113","I never thought I'd be in my position.
"
6,7,329,"00:25:38,215","00:25:42,351","I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.
"
6,7,330,"00:25:42,453","00:25:44,520","And now I find myself
addressing the lady
"
6,7,331,"00:25:44,622","00:25:46,789","of a great house in time of war.
"
6,7,332,"00:25:46,890","00:25:51,092","But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.
"
6,7,333,"00:25:52,463","00:25:54,363","It's our war.
"
6,7,334,"00:25:55,666","00:25:57,433","Go on, Ser Davos.
"
6,7,335,"00:25:59,269","00:26:01,804","Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,
"
6,7,336,"00:26:01,905","00:26:03,806","made that man his steward.
"
6,7,337,"00:26:03,907","00:26:06,709","He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew
"
6,7,338,"00:26:06,811","00:26:08,811","he had the courage to do what was right,
"
6,7,339,"00:26:08,912","00:26:11,847","even if it meant giving his life.
"
6,7,340,"00:26:11,949","00:26:15,884","Because Jeor Mormont and
Jon Snow both understood
"
6,7,341,"00:26:15,986","00:26:20,322","that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.
"
6,7,342,"00:26:20,424","00:26:22,891","It's between the living and the dead.
"
6,7,343,"00:26:24,294","00:26:26,962","And make no mistake, my lady,
"
6,7,344,"00:26:27,064","00:26:29,030","the dead are coming.
"
6,7,345,"00:26:30,701","00:26:32,368","Is this true?
"
6,7,346,"00:26:34,438","00:26:37,072","Your uncle fought them at
the Fist of the First Men.
"
6,7,347,"00:26:37,174","00:26:38,874","I fought them at Hardhome.
"
6,7,348,"00:26:38,976","00:26:40,909","We both lost.
"
6,7,349,"00:26:42,546","00:26:46,114","As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.
"
6,7,350,"00:26:46,216","00:26:50,018","And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.
"
6,7,351,"00:26:51,622","00:26:54,656","You want to protect your
people, my lady. I understand.
"
6,7,352,"00:26:54,759","00:26:56,658","But there's no hiding from this.
"
6,7,353,"00:26:56,761","00:27:00,763","We have to fight and we
need to do it together.
"
6,7,354,"00:27:11,074","00:27:15,444","House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.
"
6,7,355,"00:27:18,482","00:27:20,849","We will not break faith today.
"
6,7,356,"00:27:25,589","00:27:27,723","Thank you, my lady.
"
6,7,357,"00:27:27,825","00:27:31,026","How many fighting men can we expect?
"
6,7,358,"00:27:37,568","00:27:38,967","62.
"
6,7,359,"00:27:42,573","00:27:45,206","- 62?
- We are not a large house,
"
6,7,360,"00:27:45,309","00:27:46,642","but we're a proud one.
"
6,7,361,"00:27:46,744","00:27:48,477","And every man from Bear Island
"
6,7,362,"00:27:48,579","00:27:50,946","fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.
"
6,7,363,"00:27:51,628","00:27:54,616","If they're half as
ferocious as their lady,
"
6,7,364,"00:27:54,718","00:27:56,952","the Boltons are doomed.
"

"
6,7,366,"00:29:15,799","00:29:17,399","Blackfish.
"
6,7,367,"00:29:17,501","00:29:19,467","I assume you're here
"
6,7,368,"00:29:19,570","00:29:21,970","to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.
"
6,7,369,"00:29:22,072","00:29:25,373","I don't see Sansa and Arya.
"
6,7,370,"00:29:25,475","00:29:28,243","- I don't have them.
- Pity.
"
6,7,371,"00:29:28,345","00:29:31,179","Do you wish to resume your captivity?
"
6,7,372,"00:29:32,550","00:29:33,815","Then why are you here?
"
6,7,373,"00:29:33,918","00:29:35,651","You know why I'm here.
"
6,7,374,"00:29:35,753","00:29:37,586","This castle belongs to House Frey.
"
6,7,375,"00:29:37,688","00:29:39,220","You're trespassing.
"
6,7,376,"00:29:39,322","00:29:42,090","In the name of King Tommen, I
order you to surrender or...
"
6,7,377,"00:29:42,192","00:29:45,661","Or you'll kill Edmure?
"
6,7,378,"00:29:45,763","00:29:48,496","My nephew's marked for
death no matter what.
"
6,7,379,"00:29:48,599","00:29:50,032","Hang him and be done with it.
"
6,7,380,"00:29:50,133","00:29:51,800","It won't stop with Edmure.
"
6,7,381,"00:29:51,902","00:29:53,936","You'll force me to storm the castle.
"
6,7,382,"00:29:54,038","00:29:55,837","Hundreds will die.
"
6,7,383,"00:29:55,940","00:29:59,340","Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.
"
6,7,384,"00:29:59,443","00:30:02,010","If you can breach the walls.
"
6,7,385,"00:30:02,112","00:30:06,114","We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.
"
6,7,386,"00:30:07,551","00:30:09,785","But if you surrender,
"
6,7,387,"00:30:09,887","00:30:12,120","I'll spare the lives of your men.
"
6,7,388,"00:30:12,222","00:30:13,889","On my honor.
"
6,7,389,"00:30:13,991","00:30:15,591","Your honor?
"
6,7,390,"00:30:15,693","00:30:18,927","Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.
"
6,7,391,"00:30:19,029","00:30:20,829","The war is over, ser.
"
6,7,392,"00:30:20,931","00:30:23,599","Why sacrifice living
men to a lost cause?
"
6,7,393,"00:30:28,839","00:30:33,408","As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.
"
6,7,394,"00:30:33,849","00:30:36,444","This is my home.
"
6,7,395,"00:30:36,546","00:30:40,415","I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.
"
6,7,396,"00:30:40,517","00:30:43,384","So you can either attack
"
6,7,397,"00:30:43,487","00:30:46,187","or try to starve us out.
"
6,7,398,"00:30:46,289","00:30:49,057","We have enough provisions for two years.
"
6,7,399,"00:30:50,794","00:30:54,596","Do you have two years, Kingslayer?
"
6,7,400,"00:30:59,569","00:31:02,804","You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.
"
6,7,401,"00:31:02,906","00:31:04,640","Why did you come treat with me?
"
6,7,402,"00:31:06,010","00:31:08,043","Sieges are dull.
"
6,7,403,"00:31:08,145","00:31:11,613","And I wanted to see you in
person, get the measure of you.
"
6,7,404,"00:31:12,983","00:31:14,249","Well, now you have.
"
6,7,405,"00:31:14,351","00:31:16,384","Aye, now I have.
"
6,7,406,"00:31:16,486","00:31:18,954","I'm disappointed.
"
6,7,407,"00:31:28,298","00:31:30,298","The answer is no.
"
6,7,408,"00:31:30,400","00:31:33,535","- Lord Glover, if you could just
hear us out. - I've heard enough.
"
6,7,409,"00:31:33,637","00:31:36,337","We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.
"
6,7,410,"00:31:36,439","00:31:38,439","The Boltons helped us do it.
"
6,7,411,"00:31:38,542","00:31:40,375","Now you want me to fight against them?
"
6,7,412,"00:31:40,477","00:31:42,443","I could be skinned for
even talking to you.
"
6,7,413,"00:31:42,546","00:31:44,813","The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton...
"
6,7,414,"00:31:44,915","00:31:47,983","Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?
"
6,7,415,"00:31:48,085","00:31:50,952","House Mormont.
"
6,7,416,"00:31:51,055","00:31:52,988","And?
"
6,7,417,"00:31:53,090","00:31:55,490","We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...
"
6,7,418,"00:31:55,592","00:31:58,426","I don't care about ravens.
"
6,7,419,"00:31:58,528","00:32:00,796","You're asking me to join your army.
"
6,7,420,"00:32:00,898","00:32:04,232","Who is fighting in this army?
"
6,7,421,"00:32:09,506","00:32:12,107","The bulk of the force is
made up of wildlings.
"
6,7,422,"00:32:14,511","00:32:17,145","Then the rumors are true.
"
6,7,423,"00:32:18,816","00:32:20,916","I didn't dare believe them.
"
6,7,424,"00:32:24,454","00:32:27,689","I received you out of
respect for your father.
"
6,7,425,"00:32:27,791","00:32:29,725","Now I would like you to leave.
"
6,7,426,"00:32:29,827","00:32:33,128","House Glover will not
abandon its ancestral home
"
6,7,427,"00:32:33,230","00:32:35,864","to fight alongside wildlings.
"
6,7,428,"00:32:37,634","00:32:39,634","- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.
"
6,7,429,"00:32:39,737","00:32:41,803","I would remind you that House Glover
"
6,7,430,"00:32:41,905","00:32:43,905","is pledged to House Stark.
"
6,7,431,"00:32:44,007","00:32:46,908","Sworn to answer when called upon.
"
6,7,432,"00:32:56,954","00:33:01,089","Yes, my family served House
Stark for centuries.
"
6,7,433,"00:33:01,191","00:33:03,992","We wept when we heard
of your father's death.
"
6,7,434,"00:33:04,094","00:33:08,563","When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call
"
6,7,435,"00:33:08,665","00:33:10,799","and hailed him King in the North.
"
6,7,436,"00:33:15,839","00:33:18,073","And where was King Robb
"
6,7,437,"00:33:18,175","00:33:21,342","when the ironborn attacked this castle?
"
6,7,438,"00:33:21,444","00:33:25,080","When they threw my wife
and children in prison
"
6,7,439,"00:33:25,182","00:33:28,917","and brutalized and killed our subjects?
"
6,7,440,"00:33:29,019","00:33:32,854","Taking up with a foreign whore.
"
6,7,441,"00:33:32,956","00:33:36,825","Getting himself and those
who followed him killed.
"
6,7,442,"00:33:41,832","00:33:44,032","I served House Stark once,
"
6,7,443,"00:33:44,134","00:33:47,068","but House Stark is dead.
"
6,7,444,"00:34:44,895","00:34:47,062","Why did we have to come here?
"
6,7,445,"00:34:47,164","00:34:49,530","Some of us still like it.
"
6,7,446,"00:34:54,104","00:34:55,770","Have a drink at least.
"
6,7,447,"00:34:55,873","00:34:57,172","I don't want one.
"
6,7,448,"00:34:58,930","00:35:02,077","Don't go far, love.
"
6,7,449,"00:35:02,179","00:35:04,246","I'll find you in a bit.
"
6,7,450,"00:35:09,286","00:35:12,653","Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.
"
6,7,451,"00:35:13,073","00:35:15,357","Doesn't interest you anymore?
"
6,7,452,"00:35:18,195","00:35:21,429","I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.
"
6,7,453,"00:35:23,300","00:35:24,966","I'll never hurt you, little brother.
"
6,7,454,"00:35:25,068","00:35:26,701","Don't you know that?
"
6,7,455,"00:35:30,774","00:35:32,774","You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
"
6,7,456,"00:35:32,876","00:35:36,411","Of course he is. As long as
we're alive, we're a threat.
"
6,7,457,"00:35:36,513","00:35:38,146","He'll find us.
"
6,7,458,"00:35:38,248","00:35:40,949","It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.
"
6,7,459,"00:35:41,051","00:35:42,483","Drink.
"
6,7,460,"00:35:42,585","00:35:43,985","I don't want any.
"
6,7,461,"00:35:44,087","00:35:46,054","I don't care what you want. Drink.
"
6,7,462,"00:35:49,526","00:35:51,126","Drink it all.
"
6,7,463,"00:35:53,696","00:35:57,032","You're ironborn, Theon. I know
you've had some bad years.
"
6,7,464,"00:35:57,134","00:35:58,533","Some bad years?
"
6,7,465,"00:35:58,635","00:36:01,736","But I'm tired of watching
you cower like a beat dog.
"
6,7,466,"00:36:01,838","00:36:04,105","Drink the goddamn ale.
"
6,7,467,"00:36:08,078","00:36:10,145","Now listen to me.
"
6,7,468,"00:36:10,247","00:36:11,579","I need you.
"
6,7,469,"00:36:11,681","00:36:15,216","The real Theon Greyjoy, not
this rat shit pretender.
"
6,7,470,"00:36:15,319","00:36:17,085","Can you find him for me?
"
6,7,471,"00:36:18,455","00:36:19,955","Drink.
"
6,7,472,"00:36:21,925","00:36:23,458","You escaped. You hear me?
"
6,7,473,"00:36:23,560","00:36:26,094","You got away and you're
never going back.
"
6,7,474,"00:36:26,196","00:36:28,163","We'll get justice for you.
"
6,7,475,"00:36:28,265","00:36:30,898","If I got justice, my burnt body would
hang over the gates of Winterfell.
"
6,7,476,"00:36:31,001","00:36:33,401","Fuck justice, then. We'll
get revenge. Drink.
"
6,7,477,"00:36:38,375","00:36:40,375","Listen to me.
"
6,7,478,"00:36:40,477","00:36:43,511","If you're so broken that
there's no coming back,
"
6,7,479,"00:36:43,613","00:36:45,847","take a knife and cut your wrists.
"
6,7,480,"00:36:47,184","00:36:49,351","End it.
"
6,7,481,"00:36:49,453","00:36:53,321","But if you're staying,
Theon, I need you.
"
6,7,482,"00:36:53,423","00:36:55,823","We're gonna sail to Meereen.
"
6,7,483,"00:36:55,925","00:36:59,394","We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.
"
6,7,484,"00:36:59,496","00:37:02,297","And we're gonna take
back the Iron Islands.
"
6,7,485,"00:37:05,068","00:37:07,002","Are you with me?
"
6,7,486,"00:37:08,138","00:37:10,271","Are you really with me?
"
6,7,487,"00:37:28,091","00:37:31,726","Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,
"
6,7,488,"00:37:31,828","00:37:33,861","I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.
"
6,7,489,"00:37:45,842","00:37:49,244","Stannis camped here on
his way to Winterfell.
"
6,7,490,"00:37:49,346","00:37:51,679","And that's a good thing?
"
6,7,491,"00:37:51,781","00:37:54,516","He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.
"
6,7,492,"00:37:54,617","00:37:57,285","He chose this place for a reason.
"
6,7,493,"00:37:57,387","00:37:59,787","Those mountains are a
natural fortification.
"
6,7,494,"00:37:59,889","00:38:01,622","There's a stream down
there for the horses.
"
6,7,495,"00:38:01,724","00:38:03,558","We're not staying here long.
"
6,7,496,"00:38:03,660","00:38:05,460","Another storm could hit any day.
"
6,7,497,"00:38:05,562","00:38:08,196","Aye, the snows defeated Stannis
"
6,7,498,"00:38:08,298","00:38:10,231","as much as the Boltons did.
"
6,7,499,"00:38:10,333","00:38:14,302","We have to march on Winterfell
now while we still can.
"
6,7,500,"00:38:14,404","00:38:16,538","2,000 wildlings,
"
6,7,501,"00:38:16,639","00:38:19,541","200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...
"
6,7,502,"00:38:19,642","00:38:21,809","62 Mormonts.
"
6,7,503,"00:38:21,911","00:38:23,844","It's not what we'd hoped for.
"
6,7,504,"00:38:25,582","00:38:29,217","But we still have a chance
if we're careful and smart.
"
6,7,505,"00:38:31,521","00:38:33,588","For fuck's sake.
"
6,7,506,"00:38:36,126","00:38:39,294","So he's your most trusted advisor now?
"
6,7,507,"00:38:39,396","00:38:42,597","Because he secured 62
men from a 10-year-old?
"
6,7,508,"00:38:42,699","00:38:45,300","Ser Davos is the reason I'm
standing here talking to you
"
6,7,509,"00:38:45,402","00:38:47,569","and he served Stannis for years.
"
6,7,510,"00:38:47,670","00:38:50,305","Stannis who lost the Blackwater,
"
6,7,511,"00:38:50,407","00:38:53,808","who murdered his own brother,
who doesn't have a head?
"
6,7,512,"00:38:53,910","00:38:57,645","It's not enough. We need more men.
"
6,7,513,"00:38:58,070","00:38:59,172","There's no time.
"
6,7,514,"00:38:59,223","00:39:01,617","If we went down to Castle
Cerwyn, I know that Lord...
"
6,7,515,"00:39:01,660","00:39:04,306","We fight with the army we have.
"
6,7,516,"00:39:06,990","00:39:09,524","Friends, this is not worth fighting over!
"
6,7,517,"00:39:11,694","00:39:13,027","This'll be it, now.
"
6,7,518,"00:39:13,130","00:39:15,663","Right, now we don't
need to be fighting...
"
6,7,519,"00:39:15,765","00:39:16,671","- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.
"
6,7,520,"00:39:16,709","00:39:18,183","Yeah, who the fuck are you?
"
6,7,521,"00:40:03,680","00:40:05,880","I was a soldier once.
"
6,7,522,"00:40:05,982","00:40:08,949","All my superiors thought I was brave.
"
6,7,523,"00:40:09,052","00:40:12,119","I wasn't. I mean, I
never ran from a fight.
"
6,7,524,"00:40:12,222","00:40:15,756","Only because I was afraid my
friends would see I was afraid.
"
6,7,525,"00:40:15,858","00:40:17,758","That's all I was, a coward.
"
6,7,526,"00:40:17,860","00:40:21,729","We followed orders no matter the orders.
"
6,7,527,"00:40:21,831","00:40:24,365","Burn that village.
"

6,7,532,"00:40:37,814","00:40:40,715","I remember once a woman screaming at us,
"
6,7,533,"00:40:40,817","00:40:45,286","calling us animals as we dragged
her son from their hut.
"
6,7,534,"00:40:45,388","00:40:47,555","But we weren't animals.

"
6,7,536,"00:40:50,260","00:40:52,594","and we had betrayed ours.
"
6,7,537,"00:40:55,098","00:40:58,032","I cut that young boy's throat myself
"
6,7,538,"00:40:58,134","00:41:00,034","as his mother screamed
"
6,7,539,"00:41:00,136","00:41:02,069","and my friends held her back.
"
6,7,540,"00:41:05,709","00:41:06,974","That night...
"
6,7,541,"00:41:09,412","00:41:11,312","I felt such shame.
"
6,7,542,"00:41:12,649","00:41:14,315","Shame was so heavy on me,
"
6,7,543,"00:41:14,417","00:41:17,852","I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.
"
6,7,544,"00:41:17,954","00:41:20,722","All I could do was stare
into that dark sky
"
6,7,545,"00:41:20,823","00:41:24,325","and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.
"
6,7,546,"00:41:29,999","00:41:32,734","I'll hear her screaming

"
6,7,564,"00:42:40,370","00:42:43,938","Well, we thank you for your protection.
"
6,7,565,"00:42:44,040","00:42:46,273","Who are you protecting us from?

"
6,7,569,"00:42:55,585","00:42:59,220","Food, then. Protecting the
people is hungry work.
"
6,7,570,"00:42:59,322","00:43:01,422","I'm sure it is.
"
6,7,571,"00:43:01,524","00:43:02,923","You're welcome to stay for supper,

"
6,7,580,"00:43:53,610","00:43:55,376","Anyway, we got nothing for them.

"
6,7,591,"00:44:16,165","00:44:18,733","Violence is a disease.
"
6,7,592,"00:44:18,835","00:44:22,002","You don't cure a disease by
spreading it to more people.

"

6,8,81,"00:07:33,677","00:07:36,107","This is for masters, this technique.
"
6,8,82,"00:07:36,205","00:07:37,963","- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.
"
6,8,83,"00:07:38,061","00:07:40,363","He says he's ready.
"
6,8,84,"00:07:40,461","00:07:43,339","All right.
Now, pay attention.
"
6,8,85,"00:07:45,709","00:07:49,195","You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.
"
6,8,86,"00:07:49,293","00:07:52,459","Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.
"
6,8,87,"00:07:53,581","00:07:54,859","Very romantic.
"
6,8,88,"00:07:54,957","00:07:57,835","Take your middle finger, yeah,
"
6,8,89,"00:07:57,933","00:07:59,947","and you jam it right up her bunghole.
"
6,8,90,"00:08:02,829","00:08:04,171","<i>So fucking close!</i>
"
6,8,91,"00:08:04,269","00:08:06,795","Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
"
6,8,92,"00:08:06,893","00:08:08,427","Look at him.
You get hard, boy?
"
6,8,93,"00:08:08,525","00:08:11,467","Fuck you!
Disgusting old twats.
"
6,8,94,"00:08:15,053","00:08:17,675","Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?
"
6,8,95,"00:08:38,701","00:08:40,171","Where's the other one?
"
6,8,96,"00:08:40,269","00:08:42,699","- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!
"
6,8,97,"00:08:42,797","00:08:45,003","Those are your last words, fuck you?
"
6,8,98,"00:08:45,100","00:08:46,891","Come on, you can do better.
"
6,8,99,"00:08:46,989","00:08:48,299","Cunt!
"
6,8,100,"00:08:48,397","00:08:50,763","You're shit at dying, you know that?

"
6,8,106,"00:09:25,613","00:09:27,339","- Would you?
- Look around.
"
6,8,107,"00:09:27,437","00:09:29,451","The city has come back to life.
"
6,8,108,"00:09:29,549","00:09:33,067","- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.
"
6,8,109,"00:09:33,165","00:09:36,779","If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

it won't cut your throat.
"
6,8,111,"00:09:39,053","00:09:42,155","Spoken like a man who has
never had to shave.
"
6,8,112,"00:09:46,701","00:09:48,363","I'm going to miss you.
"
6,8,113,"00:09:48,460","00:09:49,995","I know.
"
6,8,114,"00:09:50,093","00:09:52,971","I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.
"
6,8,115,"00:09:53,069","00:09:56,203","If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.
"
6,8,116,"00:09:59,821","00:10:01,483","We need friends in Westeros.
"
6,8,117,"00:10:01,581","00:10:03,083","And we need ships.
"
6,8,118,"00:10:03,181","00:10:04,651","Most of all, we need our queen.
"
6,8,119,"00:10:04,749","00:10:08,075","She'll come back.
She has to.

6,8,120,"00:10:08,173","00:10:10,763","My heart's been broken
too many times already.
"
6,8,121,"00:10:12,749","00:10:15,115","I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

entry to the Red Keep.

6,8,129,"00:11:02,284","00:11:04,331","That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

6,8,130,"00:11:04,429","00:11:06,859","They demand to see you, Your Grace.
"
6,8,131,"00:11:06,957","00:11:08,907","Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

"
6,8,140,"00:11:45,132","00:11:47,242","It is a request, Cousin Lancel.
"
6,8,141,"00:11:47,341","00:11:49,835","You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.

6,8,144,"00:11:58,924","00:12:01,867","He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.
"
6,8,145,"00:12:01,965","00:12:03,818","He made no such promises.
"
6,8,146,"00:12:03,917","00:12:05,857","If you refuse to come of your
own free will...
"
6,8,147,"00:12:05,972","00:12:07,047","Get out.
"
6,8,148,"00:12:16,460","00:12:17,995","Move aside, ser.
"
6,8,149,"00:12:21,133","00:12:23,947","Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.
"
6,8,150,"00:12:31,245","00:12:32,843","I choose violence.

6,8,151,"00:13:12,365","00:13:15,755","Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.
"
6,8,152,"00:13:26,861","00:13:29,035","Looks like a siege, my lady.

6,8,153,"00:13:29,133","00:13:32,363","You have a keen military mind, Pod.
"
6,8,154,"00:13:41,165","00:13:43,723","My lady.
My lady.
"
6,8,155,"00:13:46,956","00:13:49,195","Who goes there?!
"
6,8,156,"00:13:49,293","00:13:50,475","State your business!
"
6,8,157,"00:13:50,573","00:13:52,523","My name is Brienne of Tarth.

"
6,8,162,"00:14:20,429","00:14:22,922","I thought you'd be dead by now.
"
6,8,163,"00:14:23,020","00:14:24,363","Not yet.
"
6,8,164,"00:14:25,997","00:14:27,978","- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.
"
6,8,165,"00:14:31,693","00:14:33,707","You think they're fucking?
"
6,8,166,"00:14:33,805","00:14:35,275","What?
"
6,8,167,"00:14:35,373","00:14:36,907","No.
"
6,8,168,"00:14:37,005","00:14:39,754","Why not?
I'd fuck her.
"
6,8,169,"00:14:39,852","00:14:41,418","You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
"
6,8,170,"00:14:41,516","00:14:43,723","- I'm her squire.
- Oh.
"
6,8,171,"00:14:43,821","00:14:46,891","Well, he'd
fuck her, that's for sure.
"
6,8,172,"00:14:46,988","00:14:48,875","And she'd fuck him, don't you think?
"
6,8,173,"00:14:48,973","00:14:50,731","The way she looks at him.
"
6,8,174,"00:14:50,828","00:14:53,227","The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.
"
6,8,175,"00:14:53,325","00:14:56,299","I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.
"
6,8,176,"00:14:56,397","00:14:59,979","Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.
"
6,8,177,"00:15:01,324","00:15:03,338","You must have shown it to her by now.
"
6,8,178,"00:15:05,293","00:15:07,882","- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?
"
6,8,179,"00:15:07,981","00:15:10,314","- Oh.
- An hour in the morning, an hour at night.
"
6,8,180,"00:15:10,412","00:15:12,138","Every day.
"
6,8,181,"00:15:12,236","00:15:15,882","Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?
"
6,8,182,"00:15:15,980","00:15:18,410","Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.
"
6,8,183,"00:15:18,508","00:15:20,043","Now, that's the truth, isn't it?
"
6,8,184,"00:15:20,141","00:15:22,602","<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>
"
6,8,185,"00:15:23,916","00:15:25,674","All right.
"
6,8,186,"00:15:25,772","00:15:27,946","All right, let's start
with your footwork.
"
6,8,187,"00:15:28,044","00:15:30,155","Show me your stance.
"
6,8,188,"00:15:31,532","00:15:33,035","Now listen to me, Pod.
"
6,8,189,"00:15:33,133","00:15:35,690","See how your feet
are about a yard apart?
"
6,8,190,"00:15:35,788","00:15:38,475","Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.
"
6,8,191,"00:15:38,572","00:15:42,506","'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.
"
6,8,192,"00:15:42,604","00:15:45,099","Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.
"
6,8,193,"00:15:45,196","00:15:46,731","<i>I never thought
you'd find her.</i>
"
6,8,194,"00:15:46,829","00:15:48,202","<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>
"
6,8,195,"00:15:48,301","00:15:50,315","Why would you assume that?
"
6,8,196,"00:15:50,413","00:15:54,186","In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.
"
6,8,197,"00:15:54,284","00:15:56,810","I don't think you know
many girls like her.
"
6,8,198,"00:15:56,908","00:15:59,722","Well, I'm proud of you.
"
6,8,199,"00:15:59,821","00:16:02,314","<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>
"
6,8,200,"00:16:02,412","00:16:04,107","<i>against all odds.</i>
"
6,8,201,"00:16:04,205","00:16:07,050","Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.
"
6,8,202,"00:16:07,149","00:16:09,642","The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,
"
6,8,203,"00:16:09,740","00:16:13,322","so there is that complication.
"
6,8,204,"00:16:15,021","00:16:16,287","What the hell are you doing here?
"
6,8,205,"00:16:16,333","00:16:17,995","I've come for the Blackfish.
"
6,8,206,"00:16:18,092","00:16:19,819","You're welcome to have him.

6,8,207,"00:16:19,917","00:16:23,530","Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

the Freys by royal decree.

Blackfish to give up the castle.

his ancestral home?

"
6,8,243,"00:18:10,348","00:18:12,907","You gave it to me for a purpose.

6,8,245,"00:18:18,765","00:18:20,362","It's yours.
"
6,8,246,"00:18:22,028","00:18:23,946","It will always be yours.

6,8,248,"00:18:34,892","00:18:36,938","Yes, Lady Brienne?

6,8,249,"00:18:37,036","00:18:40,810","Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

6,8,252,"00:18:46,764","00:18:48,746","Of course it does.

6,8,253,"00:18:48,844","00:18:50,283","To fight you.

"
6,8,262,"00:19:24,620","00:19:26,122","As I have said, my name is...

6,8,265,"00:19:30,476","00:19:33,066","And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

- No?

6,8,271,"00:19:48,140","00:19:50,986","Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?
"
6,8,272,"00:19:51,084","00:19:53,738","Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?
"
6,8,273,"00:19:53,836","00:19:57,482","Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

"
6,8,281,"00:20:33,740","00:20:36,170","She wants her home back.
I understand that.

"
6,8,283,"00:20:38,156","00:20:40,042","And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

"
6,8,408,"00:29:19,500","00:29:21,450","Good, that's...
"
6,8,409,"00:29:21,548","00:29:23,434","that's a fine thing.

6,8,410,"00:29:25,132","00:29:27,978","My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

6,8,411,"00:29:28,076","00:29:29,961","Whatever game you're playing.

6,8,412,"00:29:30,060","00:29:31,850","The Blackfish is an old man.

6,8,414,"00:29:34,059","00:29:37,002","But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

6,8,415,"00:29:38,380","00:29:40,777","A son you sired
on your wedding night.
"
6,8,416,"00:29:40,876","00:29:42,601","You're a potent man.
"
6,8,417,"00:29:42,699","00:29:44,938","A son I've never met
"
6,8,418,"00:29:45,035","00:29:47,657","born of a wife that I haven't seen
"
6,8,419,"00:29:47,755","00:29:49,034","since our first night together.
"
6,8,420,"00:29:49,132","00:29:50,602","You should be with them both.
"
6,8,421,"00:29:51,755","00:29:53,834","I can arrange that, you realize?
"
6,8,422,"00:29:53,931","00:29:55,881","Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.
"
6,8,423,"00:29:55,980","00:29:59,050","A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.
"
6,8,424,"00:29:59,148","00:30:01,482","And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

a decent person?

6,8,426,"00:30:04,012","00:30:06,441","Is that it?
"
6,8,427,"00:30:06,540","00:30:09,833","After you've massacred my family.

6,8,428,"00:30:11,180","00:30:12,906","Kept me in a cell for years.
"
6,8,429,"00:30:13,004","00:30:14,889","Stolen our lands.

6,8,430,"00:30:14,987","00:30:17,450","I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

6,8,431,"00:30:17,548","00:30:19,593","I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,
"
6,8,432,"00:30:19,691","00:30:22,090","but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

sword through his king's back.

6,8,434,"00:30:24,395","00:30:27,082","Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?
"
6,8,435,"00:30:27,179","00:30:28,362","It's not.
"
6,8,436,"00:30:30,763","00:30:33,546","You understand. On some
level you understand
"
6,8,437,"00:30:33,643","00:30:35,497","that you're an evil man.
"
6,8,438,"00:30:35,596","00:30:37,161","I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

6,8,439,"00:30:37,260","00:30:39,466","Well, that is convenient for you.

6,8,440,"00:30:42,635","00:30:46,090","You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?
"
6,8,441,"00:30:48,587","00:30:51,050","Your square jaw,

6,8,442,"00:30:51,148","00:30:52,841","your golden armor.
"
6,8,443,"00:30:54,443","00:30:57,418","Tell me, I want to know.
"
6,8,444,"00:30:57,516","00:30:59,018","I truly do.
"
6,8,445,"00:30:59,116","00:31:00,521","How do you live with yourself?
"
6,8,446,"00:31:04,107","00:31:06,154","All of us have to believe
"
6,8,447,"00:31:06,252","00:31:09,130","that we're decent, don't we?
"
6,8,448,"00:31:09,228","00:31:12,266","You have to sleep at night.
"
6,8,449,"00:31:12,364","00:31:14,698","How do you tell yourself
"
6,8,450,"00:31:14,796","00:31:17,289","that you're decent
"
6,8,451,"00:31:17,387","00:31:19,786","after everything that you've done?
"
6,8,452,"00:31:25,356","00:31:27,626","I was your sister's prisoner once.
"
6,8,453,"00:31:30,764","00:31:34,090","She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.
"
6,8,454,"00:31:36,716","00:31:38,474","Yeah.
"
6,8,455,"00:31:40,108","00:31:41,354","She should have killed you.
"
6,8,456,"00:31:41,451","00:31:43,242","Perhaps, but she didn't.
"
6,8,457,"00:31:44,587","00:31:48,169","Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

"
6,8,459,"00:31:50,539","00:31:52,041","I admired her.
"
6,8,460,"00:31:52,140","00:31:53,929","Far more than her husband or her son.
"
6,8,461,"00:31:54,027","00:31:56,201","Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?
"
6,8,462,"00:31:56,299","00:31:58,831","No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

"
6,8,464,"00:32:01,099","00:32:03,017","The love she had for her children,
"
6,8,465,"00:32:03,115","00:32:05,002","I was a little awed by it.
"
6,8,466,"00:32:05,099","00:32:07,369","Reminded me of my sister.
"
6,8,467,"00:32:07,467","00:32:10,474","Oh.
Oh, I see.
"
6,8,468,"00:32:12,236","00:32:13,962","You're a madman.
"
6,8,469,"00:32:14,060","00:32:15,849","I'm not here to trade insults.
"
6,8,470,"00:32:15,947","00:32:18,346","- Your sister was a strong...

"
6,8,471,"00:32:18,443","00:32:22,186","I'll talk about whomever I want.
"
6,8,472,"00:32:23,179","00:32:25,162","She loved her children.
"
6,8,473,"00:32:25,259","00:32:27,721","I suppose all mothers do,
"
6,8,474,"00:32:27,819","00:32:30,441","but Catelyn and Cersei,
"
6,8,475,"00:32:30,540","00:32:32,521","there's a fierceness
you don't often see.
"
6,8,476,"00:32:32,619","00:32:35,305","They'd do anything
to protect their babies.
"
6,8,477,"00:32:35,403","00:32:37,129","Start a war.
"
6,8,478,"00:32:37,227","00:32:40,842","Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

6,8,479,"00:32:40,940","00:32:43,018","The things we do for love.
"
6,8,480,"00:32:47,179","00:32:50,794","You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

6,8,481,"00:32:50,892","00:32:53,674","That's exactly why I came here.
"
6,8,482,"00:32:55,211","00:32:57,289","I love Cersei.
"
6,8,483,"00:32:57,387","00:32:59,338","You can laugh at that if you want.
"
6,8,484,"00:32:59,436","00:33:01,417","You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.
"
6,8,485,"00:33:01,516","00:33:03,305","She needs me.
"
6,8,486,"00:33:03,403","00:33:07,081","And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.
"
6,8,487,"00:33:10,379","00:33:13,386","I'll send for your baby boy.
"
6,8,488,"00:33:13,484","00:33:16,618","And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.
"
6,8,489,"00:33:16,716","00:33:19,882","Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

6,8,505,"00:34:24,876","00:34:27,561","ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.
"
6,8,506,"00:34:27,660","00:34:30,569","Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding
"
6,8,507,"00:34:30,667","00:34:33,801","would decide to let him come home?
"
6,8,508,"00:34:33,899","00:34:36,937","Because it's a trap, you idiot.

6,8,510,"00:34:38,379","00:34:40,009","He's my lord, my lord.

6,8,569,"00:43:04,459","00:43:05,577","<i>Why do you want them?</i>
"
6,8,570,"00:43:05,675","00:43:07,113","Same reason.
"
6,8,571,"00:43:07,211","00:43:09,161","I was helping build it.
"
6,8,572,"00:43:09,259","00:43:11,401","<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>
"
6,8,573,"00:43:11,499","00:43:12,713","You've got friends?
"
6,8,574,"00:43:12,811","00:43:15,560","Not anymore.
They're mine.
"
6,8,575,"00:43:15,659","00:43:18,153","It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.
"
6,8,576,"00:43:18,187","00:43:19,817","Fuck your name.
They're mine.
"
6,8,577,"00:43:19,914","00:43:21,394","I killed you once before, Dondarrion.
"
6,8,578,"00:43:21,482","00:43:23,369","Happy to do it again.
"
6,8,579,"00:43:23,467","00:43:25,641","Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
"
6,8,580,"00:43:26,986","00:43:29,321","Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.
"
6,8,581,"00:43:31,499","00:43:32,745","You can have one of them.
"
6,8,582,"00:43:37,387","00:43:38,697","Two.
"
6,8,583,"00:43:49,963","00:43:51,881","No, no, no.
"
6,8,584,"00:43:51,979","00:43:54,345","We're not butchers.
We hang them.
"
6,8,585,"00:43:54,443","00:43:56,009","Hanging?
"
6,8,586,"00:43:56,107","00:43:57,448","All over in an instant.
"
6,8,587,"00:43:57,547","00:43:58,921","Where's the punishment in that?
"
6,8,588,"00:43:59,018","00:44:01,513","- They die.
- We all bloody die.
"
6,8,589,"00:44:01,611","00:44:03,977","Except this one here.
"
6,8,590,"00:44:04,074","00:44:06,057","I'll only gut one of them.
"
6,8,591,"00:44:06,155","00:44:08,489","<i>No.</i>
"
6,8,592,"00:44:08,587","00:44:10,280","I'll chop off one hand.
"
6,8,593,"00:44:10,379","00:44:13,321","We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.
"
6,8,594,"00:44:13,418","00:44:14,761","That's generous.
"
6,8,595,"00:44:18,379","00:44:21,321","Bunch of nancies.
"
6,8,596,"00:44:21,419","00:44:23,817","There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you
"
6,8,597,"00:44:23,915","00:44:25,033","just to gut these three.
"
6,8,598,"00:44:25,131","00:44:26,377","You're getting old, Clegane.
"
6,8,599,"00:44:26,475","00:44:27,881","He's not.
"
6,8,600,"00:44:29,898","00:44:32,329","Please don't.
I'll give you anything.
"
6,8,601,"00:44:59,754","00:45:01,545","Got anything to eat?
"
6,8,602,"00:45:13,323","00:45:15,401","Enjoying yourself?
"
6,8,603,"00:45:15,499","00:45:17,480","I prefer chicken.
"
6,8,604,"00:45:18,858","00:45:22,057","You ought to join us.
We could use you.
"
6,8,605,"00:45:23,306","00:45:25,672","I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.
"
6,8,606,"00:45:25,770","00:45:28,585","Clegane, we're here for a reason.
"
6,8,607,"00:45:30,091","00:45:33,321","The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.
"
6,8,608,"00:45:33,419","00:45:35,689","He gave a failed, drunk priest
"
6,8,609,"00:45:35,786","00:45:38,408","the power to bring him
back for a reason.
"
6,8,610,"00:45:38,506","00:45:40,745","We are part of something
larger than ourselves.
"
6,8,611,"00:45:40,843","00:45:43,881","Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done
"
6,8,612,"00:45:43,979","00:45:45,961","for something larger than ourselves.
"
6,8,613,"00:45:52,971","00:45:55,849","Cold winds are rising in the North.
"
6,8,614,"00:45:55,946","00:45:58,153","And you're going to go stop them?
"
6,8,615,"00:45:59,243","00:46:00,713","We need good men to help us.
"
6,8,616,"00:46:00,811","00:46:04,424","Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.
"
6,8,617,"00:46:05,994","00:46:07,529","<i>True enough.</i>
"
6,8,618,"00:46:07,627","00:46:10,569","But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.
"
6,8,619,"00:46:10,667","00:46:13,064","Why?
"
6,8,620,"00:46:13,162","00:46:15,944","I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.
"
6,8,621,"00:46:16,042","00:46:20,105","I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord
"
6,8,622,"00:46:20,202","00:46:23,049","and I'm better than you now.
"
6,8,623,"00:46:23,147","00:46:24,873","Aye, you're probably right.
"
6,8,624,"00:46:24,971","00:46:27,689","You're a fighter.
"
6,8,625,"00:46:27,787","00:46:29,929","You were born a fighter.
"
6,8,626,"00:46:30,027","00:46:32,329","You walked away from the fight.
"
6,8,627,"00:46:32,426","00:46:34,025","How did that go?
"
6,8,628,"00:46:36,714","00:46:39,848","Good and bad, young and old,
"
6,8,629,"00:46:39,946","00:46:42,601","the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.
"
6,8,630,"00:46:44,363","00:46:47,465","<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>
"
6,8,631,"00:46:47,563","00:46:49,385","It's not too late for you.
"
6,8,632,"00:47:50,571","00:47:52,296","Lady Crane?
"
6,8,633,"00:48:00,203","00:48:01,993","<i>Lady Crane?</i>
"
6,8,634,"00:48:08,010","00:48:11,625","If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.
"
6,8,635,"00:48:13,770","00:48:15,785","Instead...
"
6,8,636,"00:48:17,770","00:48:20,136","The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.
"
6,8,637,"00:48:21,483","00:48:23,497","He must always receive what is his.
"
6,8,638,"00:48:23,594","00:48:26,185","You can't change that.
"
6,8,639,"00:48:26,283","00:48:28,617","I can't change that.
"
6,8,640,"00:48:28,715","00:48:30,665","No one can.
"
6,8,641,"00:48:33,194","00:48:35,560","And now he's been
promised another name.
"
6,8,642,"00:48:50,474","00:48:52,584","- Hey!
- Get out!
"
6,8,643,"00:48:55,339","00:48:57,193","Yah!
"
6,8,644,"00:50:13,451","00:50:15,113","Hey!
"
6,8,645,"00:50:17,803","00:50:19,561","Yah!
"
6,8,646,"00:50:20,587","00:50:22,056","Ah!
"
6,8,647,"00:50:33,675","00:50:35,912","My basket!
"
6,8,648,"00:52:06,090","00:52:07,593","It will all be over soon.
"
6,8,649,"00:52:08,970","00:52:11,656","On your knees or on your feet?
"
6,8,650,"00:52:21,962","00:52:24,104","Haven't we been through this already?
"
6,8,651,"00:52:26,187","00:52:27,880","That won't help you.
"
6,8,652,"00:53:36,650","00:53:38,600","You told her to kill me.
"
6,8,653,"00:53:45,034","00:53:46,600","Yes.
"
6,8,654,"00:53:46,698","00:53:49,064","<i>But here you are.</i>
"
6,8,655,"00:53:49,162","00:53:51,752","And there she is.
"
6,8,656,"00:54:01,546","00:54:04,296","Finally a girl is no one.
"
6,8,657,"00:54:07,562","00:54:10,920","A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell
"
6,8,658,"00:54:11,018","00:54:13,064","and I'm going home.
