"GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED’S head to him.]",1,1,Winter is Coming

JAIME: But who would he tell?,1,1,Winter is Coming
CERSEI: My husband.,1,1,Winter is Coming
"JAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off f*cking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.",1,1,Winter is Coming

ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.,1,1,Winter is Coming
THEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.,1,1,Winter is Coming
"ROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.",1,1,Winter is Coming

CATELYN: D’you know what?,1,1,Winter is Coming

"[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel.

"ROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and f*ck girls. He showed me what was what.",1,1,Winter is Coming
NED: Aye.,1,1,Winter is Coming
"ROBERT: Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.",1,1,Winter is Coming
[NED kneels.],1,1,Winter is Coming
NED: I’m not worthy of the honor.,1,1,Winter is Coming
"ROBERT: I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late.

Eddard Stark : You should have asked me 20 years ago.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.",2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : I recall a few chances.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : There was that one... Oh, what was her name ? That common girl of yours ? Becca ? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.",2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Bessie. She was one of yours.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : Bessie ! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena ? No. You told me once. Meryl ? Your b*st*rd's mother ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Wylla.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Nor will I.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.",2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.",2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it ? Should we send her a wedding gift ?,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.",2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : She's little more than a child.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Tell me we're not speaking of this.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : Oh, it's unspeakable to you ? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Eddard Stark : But you can't get your hands on this one, can you ?",2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100 000 men in his horde.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Eddard Stark : Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Eddard Stark : He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.",2,1,The Kings Road

Jon Snow : Why do you read so much ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Tyrion Lannister : Look at me and tell me what you see.,2,1,The Kings Road
Jon Snow : Is this a trick ?,2,1,The Kings Road
"Tyrion Lannister : What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.",2,1,The Kings Road
Jon Snow : Until your brother killed that King.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Tyrion Lannister : Until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree ? But how ? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you ? What's your story, b*st*rd ?",2,1,The Kings Road
"Jon Snow : Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.",2,1,The Kings Road

Robb Stark : When was the last time you left this room ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : I have to take care of him.,2,1,The Kings Road

Catelyn Stark : What if he's wrong ? Bran needs me.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robb Stark : Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...",2,1,The Kings Road

Irri : No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.,2,1,The Kings Road
Jhiqui : It is known.,2,1,The Kings Road
Doreah : A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.,2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : The moon ?,2,1,The Kings Road
"Doreah : He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.",2,1,The Kings Road
Irri : Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.,2,1,The Kings Road
Jhiqui : It is known.,2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories ?,2,1,The Kings Road
"Doreah : Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.",2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : How old were you ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Doreah : I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.,2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : Nine ?!,2,1,The Kings Road

Doreah : No.,2,1,The Kings Road
Benjen Stark : Welcome.,2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.,2,1,The Kings Road
Maester Luwin : The boy was always sure-footed before.,2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : Someone tried to kill him twice. Why ? Why murder an innocent child ? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Theon Greyjoy : Saw what, my lady ?",2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Rodrick Cassel : Did you notice the dagger the killer used ? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.",2,1,The Kings Road
Robb Stark : They come into our home and try to murder my brother ? If it's war they want...,2,1,The Kings Road
"Theon Greyjoy : If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Maester Luwin : What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood ? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.",2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : I don't trust a raven to carry these words.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robb Stark : I'll ride to King's Landing.,2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robb Stark : Mother, you can't.",2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : I must.,2,1,The Kings Road
Rodrick Cassel : I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.,2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.,2,1,The Kings Road
Rodrick Cassel : Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robb Stark : What about Bran ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Catelyn Stark : I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Doreah : No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.",2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : Finish a man ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Doreah : Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Daenerys Targaryen : Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Doreah : You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi ? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.",2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Doreah : If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you ?",2,1,The Kings Road
Daenerys Targaryen : No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : Pardon me, Ser.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Sandor Clegane : Do I frighten you so much, girl ? Or is it him there making you shake ? He frightens me too. Look at that face.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me ?",2,1,The Kings Road
Sandor Clegane : He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Joffrey Baratheon : He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady ? Does the hound frighten you ? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.",2,1,The Kings Road
Joffrey Baratheon : My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.,2,1,The Kings Road
Mycah : I'll get you !,2,1,The Kings Road

"Mycah : Mycah, my Lord.",2,1,The Kings Road
Sansa Stark : He the butcher's boy.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : He's my friend.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Joffrey Baratheon : A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh ? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Mycah : She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Joffrey Baratheon : I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Mycah : It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Joffrey Baratheon : And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that ?",2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : Stop it !,2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : Arya, stay out of this.",2,1,The Kings Road
Joffrey Baratheon : I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch !,2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything !",2,1,The Kings Road
"Joffrey Baratheon : I'll gut you, you little c**t !",2,1,The Kings Road
Sansa Stark : Arya !,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : Nymeria !,2,1,The Kings Road
Joffrey Baratheon : Please don't.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.",2,1,The Kings Road
Joffrey Baratheon : Then go ! Don't touch me.,2,1,The Kings Road
Soldier 1 : The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go ! Leave now !,2,1,The Kings Road
Soldier 2 : It's a direwolf.,2,1,The Kings Road
Soldier 1 : I'll check down here.,2,1,The Kings Road

Jory Cassel : My lord ! My lord ! They found her. She's unharmed.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Where is she ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Jory Cassel : She's been taken directly before the King.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Who took her ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Jory Cassel : The Lannisters found her.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Eddard Stark : Right, get back.",2,1,The Kings Road
Jory Cassel : The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Back ! Back to the inn. All back !,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : I'm sorry.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Are you hurt ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : No.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : It's all right. What is the meaning of this ? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : How dare you speak to your King in that manner ?,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.",2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : That's not true ! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.,2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : Joff told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : That's not what happened !,2,1,The Kings Road
Joffrey Baratheon : Yes it is ! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : Liar !,2,1,The Kings Road
Joffrey Baratheon : Shut up !,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : Enough ! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells ! What am I to make of this ? Where's your other daughter, Ned ?",2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : In bed asleep.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Cersei Baratheon : She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.",2,1,The Kings Road
Sansa Stark : I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : Liar ! Liar liar liar !,2,1,The Kings Road
Sansa Stark : Arya !,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Stop it ! That's enough of that.,2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : Liar liar liar !,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : Stop ! Arya !,2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Robert Baratheon : What would you have me do, whip her through the streets ? Damn it, children fight. It's over.",2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : You let that little girl disarm you ? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Eddard Stark : Gladly, your Grace.",2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : And what of the direwolf ? What of the beast that savaged your son ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : I'd forgot the damned wolf.,2,1,The Kings Road

Cersei Baratheon : We have another wolf.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : As you will.,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : You can't mean it.,2,1,The Kings Road
Robert Baratheon : A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.,2,1,The Kings Road
"Sansa Stark : He doesn't mean Lady, does he ? No no, not Lady ! Lady didn't bite anyone ! She's good !",2,1,The Kings Road
Arya Stark : Lady wasn't there ! You leave her alone !,2,1,The Kings Road
Sansa Stark : Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please ! It wasn't Lady !,2,1,The Kings Road

Cersei Baratheon : Where is the beast ?,2,1,The Kings Road
"Soldier : Chained up outside, your Grace.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Cersei Baratheon : Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.",2,1,The Kings Road
"Eddard Stark : No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.",2,1,The Kings Road
Cersei Baratheon : Is this some trick ?,2,1,The Kings Road
Eddard Stark : The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher. The butcher's boy... You rode him down ?,2,1,The Kings Road

I have something for you.,3,1,Lord Snow
First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.,3,1,Lord Snow
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.,3,1,Lord Snow
And now you're leaving again.,3,1,Lord Snow
I have no choice.,3,1,Lord Snow

Rapers. Not impressed by your new brothers?,3,1,Lord Snow
Lovely thing about the watch ... ,3,1,Lord Snow
You discard your old family and get a whole new one.,3,1,Lord Snow

"Jory Cassel : Yes, my Lord.",3,1,Lord Snow
King’s Landing Page : If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Glad to see you're protecting the throne.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder ? What's the line ? The King sh1ts and the Hand wipes.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : You've chosen your opponents wisely then.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : But you just stood there and watched.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger ? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Is that what you tell yourself at night ? You're a servant of justice ? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : You served him well when serving was safe.,3,1,Lord Snow
Varys : Lord Stark.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Lord Varys.,3,1,Lord Snow
Varys : I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly ! You're looking well.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Renly Baratheon : And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...",3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.",3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Grand Maester Pycelle : I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Grand Maester.,3,1,Lord Snow
Grand Maester Pycelle : How many years has it been ? You were a young man.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : And you served another King.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Grand Maester Pycelle : How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Without the King ?,3,1,Lord Snow

Grand Maester Pycelle : Can the treasury bear such expense ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80 000 ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : How could you let this happen ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Grand Maester Pycelle : Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Renly Baratheon : ""Counting coppers,"" he calls it.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Varys : You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : Please, it's nearly healed.",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : It's ugly.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Joffrey Baratheon : I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : Do I have to marry her ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather f*ck painted whores, you'll f*ck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : I don't want to.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : How would you handle them ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10 000 men to the royal army.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : A royal army ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Joffrey Baratheon : Why should every lord command his own men ? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.",3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : And if the northerners rebel ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Joffrey Baratheon : I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : And these 10 000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : For me. I'm their King.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : I'm not asking.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Cersei Baratheon : The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.",3,1,Lord Snow
Joffrey Baratheon : So you agree... The Starks are enemies ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Septa Mordane : Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : I'm practicing.,3,1,Lord Snow
Sansa Stark : Practicing for what ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : The Prince.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Septa Mordane : Arya, stop !",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.,3,1,Lord Snow
Sansa Stark : The Hound killed your friend.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.,3,1,Lord Snow
Sansa Stark : You're an idiot.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Arya Stark : You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.",3,1,Lord Snow
Septa Mordane : Enough !,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : What's happening here ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Septa Mordane : Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love. The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Sansa Stark : I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Septa Mordane : You've barely eaten a thing.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : It's all right. Go on. War was easier than daughters.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : Go away !,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : Arya, open the door. May I come in ? Whose sword is that ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : Mine.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this ? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Come here. Now what do you want with this ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : It's called Needle.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle ? Your sister ? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : Stick 'em with the pointy end.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : That's the essence of it.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Arya Stark : I hate them ! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : So was I ! He is a liar.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : But how you can let her marry someone like that ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : Winter is coming.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : I don't hate her. Not really.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right ? Go on. It's yours.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : I can keep it ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.",3,1,Lord Snow
Old Nan : Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.,3,1,Lord Snow
Bran Stark : I hate your stories.,3,1,Lord Snow
Old Nan : I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.,3,1,Lord Snow
Bran Stark : Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Old Nan : Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear ? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like ? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...",3,1,Lord Snow
Robb Stark : What are you telling him now ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Old Nan : Only what the little Lord wants to hear.,3,1,Lord Snow
Robb Stark : Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.,3,1,Lord Snow
Bran Stark : Maybe we do.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Robb Stark : How do you feel ? You still don't remember anything ? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Bran Stark : I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs ? I'd rather be dead.",3,1,Lord Snow
Robb Stark : Don't ever say that.,3,1,Lord Snow
Bran Stark : I'd rather be dead.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Rodrick Cassel : Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rodrick Cassel : My Lady.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Guard : Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : I would. We've done nothing wrong.,3,1,Lord Snow
Guard : We've been instructed to escort you into the city.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Catelyn Stark : Instructed ? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...",3,1,Lord Snow
"Guard : Follow me, Lady Stark.",3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : Cat ! Go on. Go upstairs.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : You little worm ! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a...,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : I meant no disrespect to you of all people.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : How dare you bring me here ! Have you lost your mind ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted ? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : How did you know I was coming to King's Landing ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : A dear friend told me.,3,1,Lord Snow
Varys : Lady Stark.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Lord Varys.,3,1,Lord Snow
Varys : To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : How did you know I was coming ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Varys : Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance ? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Do you know whose dagger this is ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Varys : I must admit I do not.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Yours ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : To whom ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Alliser Thorne : Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of. If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's b*st*rd bleeds like the rest of us ? Next ! Next ! Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.",3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : A charming man.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jeor Mormont : I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : And how's that going, Commander Mormont ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Jeor Mormont : Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : Good news or bad ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Jeor Mormont : Both.,3,1,Lord Snow
Grand Maester Pycelle : Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : Good news ? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : My wife is in Winterfell.,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : Is she ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : You're a funny man. A very funny man.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Ned !,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Grenn : You broke my nose, b*st*rd !",3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : It's an improvement.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Grenn : If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.",3,1,Lord Snow
Pyp : I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Grenn : What're you looking at, Half Man ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rast : What do you care about our faces ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : It's just I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Grenn : We'll talk later, Lord Snow.",3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : They hate me because I'm better than they are.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.,3,1,Lord Snow

Petyr Baelish : The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : We have proof. We have the blade.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Petyr Baelish : I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : I won't forget this. You're a true friend.,3,1,Lord Snow
Petyr Baelish : Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : How could you be so stupid ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : Calm down.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : Then what are you raving about ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : What if it comes back to him ? If he tells his father what he saw...,3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : And my husband ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : ""The War for Cersei's c**t.""",3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : Let me go.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : Never.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : Let me go.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.",3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : I wish I could see the girls.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : It's too dangerous.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Just for a moment.,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Until we know who our enemies are...,3,1,Lord Snow
"Catelyn Stark : I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.,3,1,Lord Snow
Cersei Baratheon : And if you find the proof ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Eddard Stark : Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh ? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Catelyn Stark : My temper ? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.",3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : He still loves you.,3,1,Lord Snow
Catelyn Stark : Does he ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Eddard Stark : Off with you.,3,1,Lord Snow
Robert Baratheon : It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Barristan Selmy : Of course, your Grace.",3,1,Lord Snow
Robert Baratheon : Who was it ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Barristan Selmy : A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.,3,1,Lord Snow
Robert Baratheon : How'd you do it ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Barristan Selmy : Lance through the heart.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Robert Baratheon : Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait ! Wait."" They never tell you how they all sh1t themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine ! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you ? Some halfwit with a stutter ? What are you doing ?",3,1,Lord Snow
"Lancel Lannister : It's empty, your Grace.",3,1,Lord Snow
Robert Baratheon : What do you mean it's empty ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Lancel Lannister : There's no more wine.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Robert Baratheon : Is that what empty means ? So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer ! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh ? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and sh1ts and f*cks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Barristan Selmy : I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.",3,1,Lord Snow
Jaime Lannister : You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Barristan Selmy : A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.",3,1,Lord Snow
Robert Baratheon : Your outlaw... Any last words ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : I cut his head off, so no.",3,1,Lord Snow
Robert Baratheon : What about Aerys Targaryen ? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back ? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor ? Did he plead for a reprieve ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jaime Lannister : He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace...",3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.,3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : From whom ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jorah Mormont : If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.",3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : Tell them all to stop.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : You want the entire horde to stop ? For how long ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : Until I command them otherwise.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : You're learning to talk like a Queen.,3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.,3,1,Lord Snow
Viserys Targaryen : You dare ! You give commands to me ? To me ? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Irri : Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.",3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : No !,3,1,Lord Snow
"Irri : Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Daenerys Targaryen : Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.",3,1,Lord Snow
Viserys Targaryen : Kill these Dothraki dogs ! I am your King !,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : Shall we return to the Khalasar ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : You walk.,3,1,Lord Snow
Benjen Stark : I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : You're leaving ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Benjen Stark : I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : What kind of reports ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Benjen Stark : The kind I don't want to believe.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : I'm ready. I won't let you down.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.",3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : But I'm better than every...,3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : Better than no one ! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.",3,1,Lord Snow
Yoren : A bear's balls.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : You're joking ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Yoren : And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.",3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : And how do a bear's balls taste ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Yoren : A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord ? What's the strangest thing you've eaten ?",3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : Do Dornish girls count ? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Yoren : But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : They have a better chance finding feed than glory.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it ? Is that what we are, Lannister ? An army of jesters in black ?",3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : Do you think I'm plump ? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Benjen Stark : Call me what you like.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Yoren : Are you going below ? Keep well, keep warm.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Benjen Stark : Enjoy the capital, brother.",3,1,Lord Snow
Yoren : I always do.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below"" ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Yoren : Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : So you're heading down to King's Landing too.,3,1,Lord Snow
Yoren : Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Yoren : I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.",3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Irri : Yes, Khaleesi.",3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : What are you doing ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Irri : When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi ? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Jorah Mormont : For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.",3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : Armor.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : Slow.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : Slow.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jorah Mormont : It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.",3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Rakharo : He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal ? He was a warrior also ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.,3,1,Lord Snow
Irri : The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : There are no rabbits.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Irri : Find some ducks, she likes ducks.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Rakharo : Have you seen any ducks, woman ? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head ? Do you ?",3,1,Lord Snow
Irri : Dog then. I have seen many dogs.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : I don't think she wants to eat dog.,3,1,Lord Snow
Irri : The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rakharo : A blessing from the Great Stallion.,3,1,Lord Snow
Irri : She does not want to eat horse.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.,3,1,Lord Snow
Rhakaro : We ride for Vaes Dothrak.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jorah Mormont : Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Maester Aemon : How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion ?",3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : Eight... no, nine.",3,1,Lord Snow
Maester Aemon : All of them brief ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.",3,1,Lord Snow
Maester Aemon : This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jeor Mormont : We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.",3,1,Lord Snow
Jeor Mormont : One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.,3,1,Lord Snow
Maester Aemon : The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jeor Mormont : Your sister sits by the side the King. Tell her we need help.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Maester Aemon : When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.",3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : It’s a boy.,3,1,Lord Snow
Khal Drogo : How do you know ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Daenerys Targaryen : I know.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jon Snow : I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.",3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South ?,3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Jon Snow : If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.",3,1,Lord Snow
Tyrion Lannister : Of course.,3,1,Lord Snow
Jon Snow : He'll never walk again.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Tyrion Lannister : If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Jon Snow : Farewell, My Lord.",3,1,Lord Snow
"Syrio Forel : You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : Who are you ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Syrio Forel : Your dancing master, Syrio Forel. Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : It's too heavy.,3,1,Lord Snow
Syrio Forel : It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body sideface. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.,3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : What if I drop it ?,3,1,Lord Snow
"Syrio Forel : The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm ? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : I'm a girl.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Syrio Forel : Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...",3,1,Lord Snow
Arya Stark : A needle.,3,1,Lord Snow
"Syrio Forel : Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this ? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me. Up ! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.",3,1,Lord Snow
Tell them all to stop.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
For how long?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Until I command them otherwise.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
You're learning to talk like a Queen.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Everybody knew what this place was, but no one told me ... no one but you.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
The Khaleesi have baby inside her.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
It is true. Her belly start to swell.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
I need to ride to Qohor.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
What did Aaerys Targaryen say when you stabbed him in the back?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours ... ""burn them all.""",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
I'm leaving this morning. My job is out there.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
I won't let you down.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
You're not going.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

I don't take orders from savages or their sluts.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
I don't want my brother harmed.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Mormont, kill these Dothraki dogs!",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
We've come to a dangerous place. We must protect ourselves.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Ah!,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
We allow the Northerners too much power.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
A good King knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
So you agree... The Starks are enemies?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Theon Greyjoy: We have visitors.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Bran Stark: I don't want to see anyone.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Theon Greyjoy: Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Bran Stark: I don't want to go.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Theon Greyjoy: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Tyrion Lannister: I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Robb Stark: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Tyrion Lannister: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Robb Stark: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Tyrion Lannister: Then you might learn a lord's courtesy. So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Maester Luwin: He has no memory of that day.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Tyrion Lannister: Curious.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Tyrion Lannister: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Bran Stark: I'm not a cripple.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Tyrion Lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Bran Stark: Will I really be able to ride?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Tyrion Lannister: You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Theon Greyjoy: Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Tyrion Lannister: Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Theon Greyjoy: He's not my master.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Tyrion Lannister: No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Theon Greyjoy: She wasn't feeling well.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Theon Greyjoy: My lady's whereabouts...,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Tyrion Lannister: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Theon Greyjoy: Must have been a pretty sight.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Tyrion Lannister: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Theon Greyjoy: We were outnumbered 10 to one.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Jon Snow: Enough! He yielded.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Alliser Thorne: Looks like the b*st*rd's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the b*st*rd.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Daenerys Targaryen: These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Daenerys Targaryen: If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Daenerys Targaryen: But if they did?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Jorah Mormont: King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Doreah: You have dragon's blood in your veins?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Viserys Targaryen: It's entirely possible.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Viserys Targaryen: The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Viserys Targaryen: Really? Why dragons?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Doreah: They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Viserys Targaryen: Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: I was not locked in. I have seen things.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Viserys Targaryen: What have you seen?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Viserys Targaryen: A pirate ship?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: A dragon.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Viserys Targaryen: No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen: their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: What happened to the skulls?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Viserys Targaryen: I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Doreah: That's very sad.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Viserys Targaryen: Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Doreah: No, your Grace. To teach your sister.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Viserys Targaryen: To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Eddard Stark: You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Petyr Baelish: I will?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Eddard Stark: I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: Why?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Grand Maester Pycelle: I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Eddard Stark: A book? What book?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: I'd like to read it.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: ""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.""",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Grand Maester Pycelle: As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: Jon's death...,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Grand Maester Pycelle: Such a tragedy.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: Did he say anything to you during his final hours?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: ""The seed is strong,"" I think it was.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Eddard Stark: ""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Grand Maester Pycelle: What else could it be?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: Poison.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Grand Maester Pycelle: A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Arya Stark: Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: Cats? Syrio says…,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Arya Stark: He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: He's right about that.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Arya Stark: Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Arya Stark: He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Eddard Stark: No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Arya Stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Eddard Stark: Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Petyr Baelish: A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there.

Eddard Stark: Yes.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Petyr Baelish: The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh.

"Samwell Tarly: It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Jon Snow: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Samwell Tarly: Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Samwell Tarly: Jon Snow?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Jon Snow: And why is my surname Snow?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Samwell Tarly: Because... You're a b*st*rd from the north.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Jon Snow: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another b*st*rd named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Alliser Thorne: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Jon Snow: I build my own fires.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Alliser Thorne: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Jorah Mormont: The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

"Jorah Mormont: The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
"Daenerys Targaryen: What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?",4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Jorah Mormont: Home.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Sansa Stark: And his opponent?,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things
Petyr Baelish: Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.,4,1,Cripples Bastards and Broken Things

Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.

KING ROBERT: It's a neat little trick you do -- you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: Is my father wrong?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"KING ROBERT: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles -- a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King -- their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: We still outnumber them.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
KING ROBERT: Which is the bigger number -- five or one?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: Five.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"KING ROBERT: (holds both hands up in illustration) Five ... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: What do you want?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
KING ROBERT: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now -- back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: Our marriage.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
[King Robert develops a hearty laugh as Cersei starts laughing as well.],5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"KING ROBERT: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: Every day.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
KING ROBERT: How long can hate hold a thing together?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"CERSEI: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"KING ROBERT: Yes, it is.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"CERSEI: Yes, it tis. What was she like?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"KING ROBERT: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"CERSEI: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
KING ROBERT: So why now?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"KING ROBERT: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted ... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"CERSEI: I felt something for you once, you know?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
KING ROBERT: I know.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"CERSEI: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a ... moment?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
KING ROBERT: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
CERSEI: It doesn't make me feel anything.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"[King's Landing -- Littlefinger's Brothel -- Ned Stark is in a room with Mhaegen, a prostitute and mother of King Robert's illegitimate daughter, who she is holding.

NED: I will.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"MHAEGEN: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"NED: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"MHAEGEN: He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy ... healthy.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
NED: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion

"LITTLEFINGER: Well, he has more than you, for a start.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
NED: How many?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"LITTLEFINGER: Does it matter? If you f*ck enough women, some of them will give you presents.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
NED: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
LITTLEFINGER: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
NED: (preparing to take his leave - to Jory) Come.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"[Jory remains transfixed, staring at the whores on the couch as one of them bares her breasts.]",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion

JAIME: Was! ... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is ... Lord of somewhere very far away. ,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion

NED: I remember him well.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"JAIME: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
NED: He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
[Jaime draws his sword as his men start to move forward. They are stopped when Littlefinger steps up.],5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
LITTLEFINGER: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch! (exits),5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"JAIME: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
JORY: If you threaten My Lord again --,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion

"NED: You kill me, your brother's a dead man.",5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
JAIME: You're right. (to his men) Take him alive! Kill his men!,5,1,The Wolf and The Lion
"[A short but fierce fight breaks out between the men. Outnumbered, Stark's men are felled one by one, ending with Jaime driving a dagger into Jory's eye. Ned Stark takes on Jaime while all remaining watch. Their sword fight is brought to an abrupt end when one of Jaime's guards spears the back of Ned's leg, bringing him to his knees.

I miss girls.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Just looking at them,",7,1,You Win or You Die
hearing them giggle.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Don't you miss girls?,7,1,You Win or You Die
Riders.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The horn. We have to blow the horn.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Why is he alone?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for ...  there's no rider.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"[i]Whoa, boy, whoa.",7,1,You Win or You Die
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Where's my Uncle?,7,1,You Win or You Die
Ned!,7,1,You Win or You Die
It's Robert. We were hunting ... a boar ... ,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.",7,1,You Win or You Die
I was never meant to be a father.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Go on.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You don't want to see this.,7,1,You Win or You Die
My fault.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Too much wine, missed my thrust.",7,1,You Win or You Die
It stinks.,7,1,You Win or You Die
It stinks like death.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Don't think I can't smell it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I paid the b*st*rd back, Ned.",7,1,You Win or You Die
I drove my knife right through his brain.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You ask them if I didn't.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Ask them!,7,1,You Win or You Die
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.,7,1,You Win or You Die
And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Robert, my sweet ... ",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Out, all of you!",7,1,You Win or You Die
You damned fool.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"""In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of ... "" you know how it goes.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Fill in the damn titles.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"""I hereby command Eddard of House Stark ... "" titles, titles ... ",7,1,You Win or You Die
"""to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death, to rule in my stead until my son Joffrey comes of age.""",7,1,You Win or You Die
Give it over.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Give it to the council after I'm dead.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You'll rule now.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.",7,1,You Win or You Die
The girl ... ,7,1,You Win or You Die
Daenerys.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother... Worthless.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"No one to tell me ""no"" but you.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Only you.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Let her live.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Stop it, if it's not too late.",7,1,You Win or You Die
I will.,7,1,You Win or You Die
And my son...,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Help him, Ned.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Make him better than me.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'll...,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.,7,1,You Win or You Die
My memory.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Give me something for the pain and let me die.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Give him milk of the poppy.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He was reeling from the wine.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"He commanded us to step aside, but...",7,1,You Win or You Die
I failed him.,7,1,You Win or You Die
No man could have protected him from himself.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?",7,1,You Win or You Die
"His squire, from the king's own skin.",7,1,You Win or You Die
His squire? The Lannister boy?,7,1,You Win or You Die
Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.,7,1,You Win or You Die
His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once.",7,1,You Win or You Die
I'm afraid those birds have flown.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The girl is likely dead already.,7,1,You Win or You Die
...Throne.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Throne.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Can't you help me make him understand?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Have I said something funny, Ser?",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.",7,1,You Win or You Die
He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.,7,1,You Win or You Die
And because he had dragons.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You don't believe it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?",7,1,You Win or You Die
I believe what my eyes and ears report.,7,1,You Win or You Die
As for the rest... It was 300 years ago.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Who knows what really happened?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me.",7,1,You Win or You Die
I'll come with you.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"No no, don't trouble yourself.",7,1,You Win or You Die

Princess.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Rise.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'd still like to taste that wine.,7,1,You Win or You Die
That? Dornish swill.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Not worthy of a princess.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I have a dry red from the Arbor ... nectar of the Gods.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Let me give you a cask. Uh ... a gift.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"You honor me, Ser.",7,1,You Win or You Die

I hope to repay your kindness someday.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Rakharo.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Huh.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Is something wrong?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I have a thirst.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Open it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Open it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Pour.,7,1,You Win or You Die
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Do as he says.,7,1,You Win or You Die
As the princess commands.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Sweet, isn't it?",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Can you smell the fruit, Ser?",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Taste it, My Lord.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You first.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Me?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You will drink.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Khaleesi!,7,1,You Win or You Die

Tonight...,7,1,You Win or You Die
You're allowed to look happy.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You're going to be a Ranger.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Isn't that what you always wanted?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I want to find my Uncle.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I know he's alive out there.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I know he is.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.",7,1,You Win or You Die
It's the steward's life for me.,7,1,You Win or You Die

"Not much, really.",7,1,You Win or You Die
But there's food.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Here you begin anew.,7,1,You Win or You Die
A man of The Night's Watch...,7,1,You Win or You Die
Lives his life for the realm.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house",7,1,You Win or You Die
or that house; not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love; but for the realm and all the people in it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You've all learned the words of the vow.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Think carefully before you say them.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The penalty for desertion is death.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You can take your vows here tonight at sunset.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Do any of you still keep the old Gods?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I do, My Lord.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Yes, My Lord.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall.,7,1,You Win or You Die

"Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Make no comment about his nose.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Certainly.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Do you take me for a servant?,7,1,You Win or You Die
We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.,7,1,You Win or You Die
But perhaps we were wrong in that.,7,1,You Win or You Die
May I go?,7,1,You Win or You Die
As you wish.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Jon, wait!",7,1,You Win or You Die
Don't you see what they're doing?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.",7,1,You Win or You Die
He wanted it and he got it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Stewards are nothing but maids!,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!,7,1,You Win or You Die
It's not fair.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Fair?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.,7,1,You Win or You Die
So now I'm here ... at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little sh1ts like you.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'll never see my family again.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I'll never be inside a woman again.,7,1,You Win or You Die
So don't tell me about fair.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?,7,1,You Win or You Die
You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Now listen to me.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You'll be with him day and night.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Yes, you'll clean his clothes.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"You'll know everything, be part of everything.",7,1,You Win or You Die
And he asked for you himself.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He wants to groom you for command.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I just...,7,1,You Win or You Die
I always wanted to be a Ranger.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I always wanted to be a Wizard.,7,1,You Win or You Die
What?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"No, I'm serious.",7,1,You Win or You Die
So you'll stay and say your words with me?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Lord Stark, a moment.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Alone if you will.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He named you Protector of the Realm.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He did.,7,1,You Win or You Die
She won't care.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.,7,1,You Win or You Die
And what should I do with a hundred swords?,7,1,You Win or You Die
Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.,7,1,You Win or You Die
We must get Joffrey away fro his mother and into our custody.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.",7,1,You Win or You Die
What about Stannis?,7,1,You Win or You Die
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?,7,1,You Win or You Die
You have odd notions about protecting the realm.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Stannis is your older brother.,7,1,You Win or You Die
This isn't about the bloody line of succession.,7,1,You Win or You Die
That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King.,7,1,You Win or You Die
It shouldn't matter now.,7,1,You Win or You Die
What's best for the Kingdoms?,7,1,You Win or You Die
What's best for the people we rule?,7,1,You Win or You Die
We all know what Stannis is.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He inspires no love or loyalty.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He's not a King.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I am.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Stannis is a commander.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He's led men into war twice.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet ... ,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that.",7,1,You Win or You Die
So was Robert.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Tell me something:,7,1,You Win or You Die
Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You will sail to dragonstone tonight.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Only Stannis himself.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Yes, My Lord.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Now leave us.,7,1,You Win or You Die
My Lord protector.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The King has no trueborn sons.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.,7,1,You Win or You Die
So when the King dies ... ,7,1,You Win or You Die
The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.,7,1,You Win or You Die
So it would seem.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Unless ... there is no ""unless.""",7,1,You Win or You Die
He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.,7,1,You Win or You Die
And he cannot take the throne without your help.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Do you have a shred of honor?,7,1,You Win or You Die
You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.,7,1,You Win or You Die
All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Make peace with the Lannisters.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.,7,1,You Win or You Die
We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.",7,1,You Win or You Die
We?,7,1,You Win or You Die
You'll need someone to share these burdens.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I assure you ... my price would be modest.,7,1,You Win or You Die
What you suggest is treason.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Only if we lose.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say...",7,1,You Win or You Die
With the people who tried to murder my boy.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"We only make peace with our enemies, My Lord.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"That's why it's called ""making peace.""",7,1,You Win or You Die
No. I won't do it.,7,1,You Win or You Die
So it will be Stannis and war?,7,1,You Win or You Die
There is no other choice.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He is the heir.,7,1,You Win or You Die
So why did you call me here?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Not for my wisdom, clearly.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You promised Catelyn you would help me.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms ... enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I need the gold cloaks.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Look at you.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?",7,1,You Win or You Die
Who do they follow?,7,1,You Win or You Die
The man who pays them.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Night gathers and now my watch begins.,7,1,You Win or You Die
It shall not end until my death. ,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.",7,1,You Win or You Die
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I shall live and die at my post.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I am the sword in the darkness.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I am the watcher on the walls.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"I pledge my li and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.",7,1,You Win or You Die
You knelt as boys.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Well done. Well done.,7,1,You Win or You Die
What's he got there?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"To me, ghost. Bring it here.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Gods be good!,7,1,You Win or You Die
What will they do to him?,7,1,You Win or You Die
"When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.",7,1,You Win or You Die
And when he falls?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I saw a man last nine miles once.,7,1,You Win or You Die
King Robert still wants me dead.,7,1,You Win or You Die
This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.,7,1,You Win or You Die
I thought he'd leave me alone ... now that my brother is gone.,7,1,You Win or You Die
He will never leave you alone.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.",7,1,You Win or You Die
"If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him.",7,1,You Win or You Die
He will never abandon the hunt.,7,1,You Win or You Die
You're a Targaryen ...  the last Targaryen.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him.",7,1,You Win or You Die
He will not have my son.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"He will not have you either, Khaleesi.",7,1,You Win or You Die
Lord Stark!,7,1,You Win or You Die
Stop!,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Ned: No, all right.",7,1,You Win or You Die
It's all right. Let him through.,7,1,You Win or You Die
"Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.",7,1,You Win or You Die
King Joffrey?,7,1,You Win or You Die
King Robert is gone.,7,1,You Win or You Die
The Gods give him rest.,7,1,You Win or You Die
All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Good.,7,1,You Win or You Die
Is Lord Renly joining us?,7,1,You Win or You Die
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.,7,1,You Win or You Die

Sit.,8,1,The Pointy End
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.,8,1,The Pointy End
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.,8,1,The Pointy End
I hope you're not thinking,8,1,The Pointy End
of doing anything stupid.,8,1,The Pointy End
Your duty lies here now.,8,1,The Pointy End
My sisters were in King's Landing too.,8,1,The Pointy End
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.",8,1,The Pointy End
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.,8,1,The Pointy End
He wouldn't do that.,8,1,The Pointy End
He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.,8,1,The Pointy End

Send for my father. He'll tell you ... the King was his friend.,8,1,The Pointy End

Yet you are the daughter,8,1,The Pointy End
of a traitor.,8,1,The Pointy End
How can I allow you to marry my son?,8,1,The Pointy End
A child born,8,1,The Pointy End
of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.,8,1,The Pointy End
"She is a sweet thing now,",8,1,The Pointy End
"Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?",8,1,The Pointy End
"No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.",8,1,The Pointy End
"I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything.",8,1,The Pointy End

Best it comes from you.,8,1,The Pointy End

Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.,8,1,The Pointy End
"If ... if I could see my father, talk to him about ... ",8,1,The Pointy End
"You disappoint me, child.",8,1,The Pointy End
We have told you of your father's treason.,8,1,The Pointy End
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?,8,1,The Pointy End
I only meant that ... what will happen to him?,8,1,The Pointy End
That depends.,8,1,The Pointy End
On ... on what?,8,1,The Pointy End
On your brother.,8,1,The Pointy End
And on you.,8,1,The Pointy End
Treason?,8,1,The Pointy End
Sansa wrote this?,8,1,The Pointy End
"It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.",8,1,The Pointy End
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?",8,1,The Pointy End
"This is a royal command, My Lord.",8,1,The Pointy End
If you should refuse to obey ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
I won't refuse.,8,1,The Pointy End
"His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.",8,1,The Pointy End
But not alone.,8,1,The Pointy End
Call the banners.,8,1,The Pointy End
"All of them, My Lord?",8,1,The Pointy End
"They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?",8,1,The Pointy End
They have.,8,1,The Pointy End
Now we see what their words are worth.,8,1,The Pointy End
Yeah.,8,1,The Pointy End
Are you afraid?,8,1,The Pointy End
I must be.,8,1,The Pointy End
Good.,8,1,The Pointy End
Why is that good?,8,1,The Pointy End
It means you're not stupid.,8,1,The Pointy End
You've had this since dawn?,8,1,The Pointy End
"He sent it to me, not you.",8,1,The Pointy End
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.,8,1,The Pointy End
A courtesy?!,8,1,The Pointy End
My husband has been taken prisoner.,8,1,The Pointy End
My son intends to declare war.,8,1,The Pointy End
A war?,8,1,The Pointy End
Your son against the Lannisters?,8,1,The Pointy End
You should go to him. Teach him patience.,8,1,The Pointy End
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?,8,1,The Pointy End
He is your brother by law!,8,1,The Pointy End
Does family mean nothing to you?,8,1,The Pointy End
Family means everything to me.,8,1,The Pointy End
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.,8,1,The Pointy End
I'm hungry.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Hush now, darling.",8,1,The Pointy End
You just ate.,8,1,The Pointy End
You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?,8,1,The Pointy End
But I'm hungry!,8,1,The Pointy End
"Soon, love, soon.",8,1,The Pointy End
"You're always welcome here, sister.",8,1,The Pointy End
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
That is what I ask.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Go on, sweet. Time for your bath.",8,1,The Pointy End
I'll feed you after.,8,1,The Pointy End
If you fear for the safety of your son ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!,8,1,The Pointy End
Are you an idiot?,8,1,The Pointy End
They killed my husband.,8,1,The Pointy End
You say they shoved,8,1,The Pointy End
your boy from a window.,8,1,The Pointy End
These people will do anything.,8,1,The Pointy End
And that is why we have to stop them.,8,1,The Pointy End
"The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.",8,1,The Pointy End
Will you shut up?,8,1,The Pointy End
There's hill tribes all around here.,8,1,The Pointy End
"If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.",8,1,The Pointy End
I should just take your food and leave you here.,8,1,The Pointy End
Eh? What would you do then?,8,1,The Pointy End
"Starve, most likely.",8,1,The Pointy End
"You don't think I'd do it, do you?",8,1,The Pointy End
"What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women?",8,1,The Pointy End
Golden women?,8,1,The Pointy End
"Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.",8,1,The Pointy End
But you knew that.,8,1,The Pointy End
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.,8,1,The Pointy End
Fair enough.,8,1,The Pointy End
"But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and ""My Lord"" you every time you take a sh1t.",8,1,The Pointy End
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.",8,1,The Pointy End
"And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:",8,1,The Pointy End
"Whatever their price, I'll beat it.",8,1,The Pointy End
I like living.,8,1,The Pointy End
Tyrion.,8,1,The Pointy End
Tyrion.,8,1,The Pointy End
Tyrion.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Come, share our fire.",8,1,The Pointy End
Help yourselves to our goat.,8,1,The Pointy End
"When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.",8,1,The Pointy End
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.,8,1,The Pointy End
"How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?",8,1,The Pointy End
"In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.",8,1,The Pointy End
Take the half man.,8,1,The Pointy End
He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.,8,1,The Pointy End
No no no no no!,8,1,The Pointy End
My ... my House is rich and powerful.,8,1,The Pointy End
"If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.",8,1,The Pointy End
We have no use for a half man's promises.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.",8,1,The Pointy End
What do the Stone Crows do?,8,1,The Pointy End
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?,8,1,The Pointy End
Are those the best weapons you could steal?,8,1,The Pointy End
"Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.",8,1,The Pointy End
Lannister smiths sh1t better steel.,8,1,The Pointy End
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?,8,1,The Pointy End
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.,8,1,The Pointy End
"But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.",8,1,The Pointy End
I will give you this.,8,1,The Pointy End
"What is ""this""?",8,1,The Pointy End
The Vale of Arryn.,8,1,The Pointy End
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.,8,1,The Pointy End
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.,8,1,The Pointy End
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.,8,1,The Pointy End

You're confined to quarters. Go.,8,1,The Pointy End

"Jorah, make them stop.",8,1,The Pointy End

I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.,8,1,The Pointy End
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord. But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.,8,1,The Pointy End

They'll be back soon. Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.,8,1,The Pointy End
"No, they won't.",8,1,The Pointy End
Please watch,8,1,The Pointy End
over Robb.,8,1,The Pointy End
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.,8,1,The Pointy End
"And Theon too, I suppose.",8,1,The Pointy End
"You hear them, boy?",8,1,The Pointy End
The Old Gods are answering you.,8,1,The Pointy End
What are you doing here?,8,1,The Pointy End
They're my Gods too.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.",8,1,The Pointy End
Even slaves are allowed to pray.,8,1,The Pointy End
You're not a slave.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.",8,1,The Pointy End
"I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.",8,1,The Pointy End
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?,8,1,The Pointy End
"You asked them, they're answering you.",8,1,The Pointy End
Shh.,8,1,The Pointy End
Open your ears.,8,1,The Pointy End
It's only the wind.,8,1,The Pointy End
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?,8,1,The Pointy End
"They see you, boy.",8,1,The Pointy End
They hear you.,8,1,The Pointy End
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.,8,1,The Pointy End
The Old Gods have no power in the South.,8,1,The Pointy End
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.,8,1,The Pointy End
How can they watch when they have no eyes?,8,1,The Pointy End
"Well, there's a big man.",8,1,The Pointy End
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.",8,1,The Pointy End
Go dress.,8,1,The Pointy End
Hodor.,8,1,The Pointy End
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?,8,1,The Pointy End
Giants and worse than giants.,8,1,The Pointy End
"I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.",8,1,The Pointy End
"All these swords, they should be going North, boy.",8,1,The Pointy End
"North, not south!",8,1,The Pointy End
The cold winds are rising.,8,1,The Pointy End
They were touched by White Walkers.,8,1,The Pointy End
That's why they came back.,8,1,The Pointy End
That's why their eyes turned blue.,8,1,The Pointy End
Only fire will stop them.,8,1,The Pointy End
How do you know that?,8,1,The Pointy End
I read about it in a book ... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.,8,1,The Pointy End
What else did the book say?,8,1,The Pointy End
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.,8,1,The Pointy End
And when they wake up ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
"And when they wake up, what?",8,1,The Pointy End
I hope The Wall is high enough.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Summer snows, My Lady.",8,1,The Pointy End
Robb's brought the North with him.,8,1,The Pointy End
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.,8,1,The Pointy End
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.,8,1,The Pointy End
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.,8,1,The Pointy End
"One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts",8,1,The Pointy End
10 times as large.,8,1,The Pointy End
Mother!,8,1,The Pointy End
You look well.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.",8,1,The Pointy End
"We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.",8,1,The Pointy End
I had not thought to be here.,8,1,The Pointy End
I would speak with my son alone.,8,1,The Pointy End
"I know you will forgive me, My Lords.",8,1,The Pointy End
You heard her! Move your asses!,8,1,The Pointy End
"Come on, out.",8,1,The Pointy End
"You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?",8,1,The Pointy End
"Have no fear, My Lady.",8,1,The Pointy End
We'll shove our swords,8,1,The Pointy End
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.,8,1,The Pointy End
"You old devil, Rodrik.",8,1,The Pointy End
Jon.,8,1,The Pointy End
"You're not wasting away, are you?",8,1,The Pointy End
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.,8,1,The Pointy End
And now I find you leading a host to war.,8,1,The Pointy End
There was no one else.,8,1,The Pointy End
No one?,8,1,The Pointy End
Who were those men I saw here?,8,1,The Pointy End
None of them are Starks.,8,1,The Pointy End
All of them are seasoned in battle.,8,1,The Pointy End
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
"Oh, would that I could.",8,1,The Pointy End
There was... a letter.,8,1,The Pointy End
From Sansa.,8,1,The Pointy End
"From the Queen, you mean.",8,1,The Pointy End
There's no mention of Arya.,8,1,The Pointy End
No.,8,1,The Pointy End
How many men do you have?,8,1,The Pointy End
"18,000.",8,1,The Pointy End
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey ... you would never be allowed to leave. No.,8,1,The Pointy End
Our best hope ... our only hope ... is that you can defeat them in the field.,8,1,The Pointy End
And if I lose?,8,1,The Pointy End
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children when the Mad King fell?,8,1,The Pointy End
They were butchered in their sleep.,8,1,The Pointy End
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.,8,1,The Pointy End
And the years have not made him kinder.,8,1,The Pointy End
"If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die,",8,1,The Pointy End
we die.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Well, that makes it simple then.",8,1,The Pointy End
I suppose it does.,8,1,The Pointy End
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.,8,1,The Pointy End
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.,8,1,The Pointy End
Not best for me.,8,1,The Pointy End
"If the half man betrays us, Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood ... and feed it to the goats, yes.",8,1,The Pointy End
All right then.,8,1,The Pointy End
Time to meet my father.,8,1,The Pointy End
Tyrion.,8,1,The Pointy End
Uncle.,8,1,The Pointy End
Father.,8,1,The Pointy End
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.,8,1,The Pointy End
Sorry to disappoint you.,8,1,The Pointy End
And who are these...,8,1,The Pointy End
Companions of yours?,8,1,The Pointy End
"This is Shagga Son of Dolf,",8,1,The Pointy End
Chieftain,8,1,The Pointy End
of the Stone Crows.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Timett Son of Timett,",8,1,The Pointy End
ruler of the Burned Men.,8,1,The Pointy End
This fair maid is,8,1,The Pointy End
"Chella daughter of Cheyk,",8,1,The Pointy End
leader,8,1,The Pointy End
of the Black Ears.,8,1,The Pointy End
And here we have Bronn son of...,8,1,The Pointy End
You wouldn't know him.,8,1,The Pointy End
"May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,",8,1,The Pointy End
Lord of Casterly Rock,8,1,The Pointy End
and Warden of the West?,8,1,The Pointy End
Kind of you to go to war for me.,8,1,The Pointy End
You left us no choice.,8,1,The Pointy End
The honor of the House was at stake.,8,1,The Pointy End
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.,8,1,The Pointy End
"We have our differences, Jaime and I.",8,1,The Pointy End
He's braver. I'm better looking.,8,1,The Pointy End
He's been covering himself in glory.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.",8,1,The Pointy End
And the Starks? Lord Eddard?,8,1,The Pointy End
... Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.,8,1,The Pointy End
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?,8,1,The Pointy End
Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.,8,1,The Pointy End
"My sister rules, you mean.",8,1,The Pointy End
Stark's son has called his banners.,8,1,The Pointy End
He moves south with a strong host.,8,1,The Pointy End
A green boy.,8,1,The Pointy End
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.,8,1,The Pointy End
Maybe.,8,1,The Pointy End
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.,8,1,The Pointy End
You'd like him.,8,1,The Pointy End
"While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.",8,1,The Pointy End
We shall require,8,1,The Pointy End
"3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces ... if it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.",8,1,The Pointy End
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.,8,1,The Pointy End
"So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.",8,1,The Pointy End
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.,8,1,The Pointy End
"At once, My Lord.",8,1,The Pointy End
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.,8,1,The Pointy End
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.,8,1,The Pointy End
Only if the half man fights with us.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.",8,1,The Pointy End
The scouts report,8,1,The Pointy End
Lord Tywin moves north.,8,1,The Pointy End
"We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.",8,1,The Pointy End
"No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.",8,1,The Pointy End
Do that and the River Lords will join us.,8,1,The Pointy End
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.,8,1,The Pointy End
Lord Frey controls,8,1,The Pointy End
that bridge.,8,1,The Pointy End
Your father's bannerman.,8,1,The Pointy End
"""The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him.",8,1,The Pointy End
"At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.",8,1,The Pointy End
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.,8,1,The Pointy End
Robb's right. We need that bridge.,8,1,The Pointy End
So what's it going to be?,8,1,The Pointy End
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?,8,1,The Pointy End
"Your pardon, my lords.",8,1,The Pointy End
We've captured,8,1,The Pointy End
a Lannister scout.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Don't worry, lad. He won't b leaving this tent with his head.",8,1,The Pointy End
Where did you find him?,8,1,The Pointy End
In the brush above the encampment.,8,1,The Pointy End
He looked to be counting.,8,1,The Pointy End
How high did you get?,8,1,The Pointy End
"20,000. Maybe more.",8,1,The Pointy End
You don't have to do this yourself.,8,1,The Pointy End
Your father would understand ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
"My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.",8,1,The Pointy End
And he understands honor... and courage.,8,1,The Pointy End
Let him go.,8,1,The Pointy End
Robb.,8,1,The Pointy End
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.,8,1,The Pointy End
"20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does sh1t gold.",8,1,The Pointy End
"Yes, My Lord.",8,1,The Pointy End
"Thank you, My Lord.",8,1,The Pointy End
"Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?",8,1,The Pointy End
You call me boy again.,8,1,The Pointy End
Go on.,8,1,The Pointy End
Oi.,8,1,The Pointy End
It is also the wish,8,1,The Pointy End

Every man and woman in the,8,1,The Pointy End
Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.,8,1,The Pointy End

"Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.",8,1,The Pointy End
Our vows are,8,1,The Pointy End
taken for life.,8,1,The Pointy End
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.,8,1,The Pointy End
"Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?",8,1,The Pointy End
You let my father die.,8,1,The Pointy End
You're too old to protect anybody.,8,1,The Pointy End
Your Grace ... ,8,1,The Pointy End
The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place,8,1,The Pointy End

I am a Knight.,8,1,The Pointy End
I shall die a Knight.,8,1,The Pointy End
"A naked Knight, apparently.",8,1,The Pointy End
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!,8,1,The Pointy End
"Here, boy!",8,1,The Pointy End
Melt it down and add it to the others.,8,1,The Pointy End

I do.,8,1,The Pointy End

Let her speak.,8,1,The Pointy End
I want to hear what she says.,8,1,The Pointy End

Do you deny your father's crime?,8,1,The Pointy End
"No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.",8,1,The Pointy End
All I ask is mercy.,8,1,The Pointy End
I know My Lord father,8,1,The Pointy End
must regret what he did.,8,1,The Pointy End
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.,8,1,The Pointy End
You all know he loved him.,8,1,The Pointy End
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.,8,1,The Pointy End
They must have lied to him ... Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody. They must have lied!,8,1,The Pointy End
He said I wasn't the King.,8,1,The Pointy End
Why did he say that?,8,1,The Pointy End
He was badly hurt.,8,1,The Pointy End
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.,8,1,The Pointy End
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h never would have said it.,8,1,The Pointy End
A child's faith... Such sweet innocence.,8,1,The Pointy End
And yet they say,8,1,The Pointy End
wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.,8,1,The Pointy End
Treason is treason!,8,1,The Pointy End
Anything else?,8,1,The Pointy End
"If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.",8,1,The Pointy End
Your sweet words have moved me.,8,1,The Pointy End
But your father has to confess.,8,1,The Pointy End

When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?,9,1,Baelor
"Soon, he says.",9,1,Baelor
Good.,9,1,Baelor
You'll be ready for this then.,9,1,Baelor
I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear...,9,1,Baelor
So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw.,9,1,Baelor
"Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.",9,1,Baelor
This is Valyrian steel.,9,1,Baelor
"It was my father's sword, his father before him.",9,1,Baelor
The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.,9,1,Baelor
It was meant for my son Jorah.,9,1,Baelor

I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.,9,1,Baelor
No you won't!,9,1,Baelor
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.,9,1,Baelor
The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist ... ,9,1,Baelor
I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this...,9,1,Baelor
Boy King.,9,1,Baelor
That should get young Joffrey's attention.,9,1,Baelor
And it puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne.,9,1,Baelor
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.,9,1,Baelor
"Yes, My Lord.",9,1,Baelor

And yet you really want to say.,9,1,Baelor
You want to say that...?,9,1,Baelor
There was a raven.,9,1,Baelor

It's your brother Robb.,9,1,Baelor
What?,9,1,Baelor
What about him?,9,1,Baelor
He's heading south.,9,1,Baelor
To war.,9,1,Baelor
All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.,9,1,Baelor
I should be there.,9,1,Baelor
I should be with him.,9,1,Baelor
"...If we do that, they'll never get back across.",9,1,Baelor
Well?,9,1,Baelor
What did he say?,9,1,Baelor
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.,9,1,Baelor
His men are yours as well ... ,9,1,Baelor
Greatjon: Huh.,9,1,Baelor
... Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.,9,1,Baelor
And what does he want in return?,9,1,Baelor
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.,9,1,Baelor
He expects a knighthood in good time.,9,1,Baelor
Fine fine.,9,1,Baelor
And?,9,1,Baelor
And Arya will marry his son Waldron,9,1,Baelor

And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing.,10,1,Fire and Blood

I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you.,10,1,Fire and Blood

"They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them.",10,1,Fire and Blood
Yes.,10,1,Fire and Blood
And keep on serving them.,10,1,Fire and Blood
"Aerys Targaryen... of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst.",10,1,Fire and Blood
"He was a good man, such a charmer.",10,1,Fire and Blood
"To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood...",10,1,Fire and Blood
"Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal ... powerful man, a great warrior ... but alas, winning a Kingdom and ruling a Kingdom are rather different things.",10,1,Fire and Blood

"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?",10,1,Fire and Blood
"Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?",10,1,Fire and Blood
It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.,10,1,Fire and Blood
A man with great ambition and no morals ... ,10,1,Fire and Blood
I wouldn't bet against you.,10,1,Fire and Blood
"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?",10,1,Fire and Blood
I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.,10,1,Fire and Blood
You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.,10,1,Fire and Blood
"Oh, you can do better than that.",10,1,Fire and Blood
"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones?",10,1,Fire and Blood
I've always wondered.,10,1,Fire and Blood
Have you?,10,1,Fire and Blood
Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?,10,1,Fire and Blood
I picture a gash like a woman's. Is that about right?,10,1,Fire and Blood

"Must be strange for you, even after all these years ... a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all ... am I? That is good to know.",10,1,Fire and Blood
Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?,10,1,Fire and Blood
"But you carry on, whispering in one King's ear and then the next.",10,1,Fire and Blood
I admire you.,10,1,Fire and Blood
"And I admire you, Lord Baelish.",10,1,Fire and Blood

"So keep to yourself ... and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.",10,1,Fire and Blood

What are you doing here?,1,2,The North Remembers
"Ah, it's been a remarkable journey.",1,2,The North Remembers
"I pissed off the edge of the Wall,",1,2,The North Remembers
"I slept in a sky cell,",1,2,The North Remembers
"I fought with the hill tribes ... so many adventures, so much to be thankful for.",1,2,The North Remembers
What are you doing here? This is the small council.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Yes. well I, do believe, the Hand of the King, is welcome at all small council meetings.",1,2,The North Remembers
Our father is Hand of the King.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Yes, but in his absence...",1,2,The North Remembers
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights.,1,2,The North Remembers
Out! All of you out!,1,2,The North Remembers
I would like to know how you tricked father into this.,1,2,The North Remembers
"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now.",1,2,The North Remembers
You brought this on yourself.,1,2,The North Remembers
I've done nothing.,1,2,The North Remembers
Quite right ... you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head.,1,2,The North Remembers
Now the entire North has risen up against us.,1,2,The North Remembers
I tried to stop it.,1,2,The North Remembers
Did you? You failed.,1,2,The North Remembers
That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.,1,2,The North Remembers
Robb Stark is a child.,1,2,The North Remembers
Who's won every battle he's fought.,1,2,The North Remembers
Do you understand we're losing the war?,1,2,The North Remembers
What do you know about warfare?,1,2,The North Remembers
Nothing.,1,2,The North Remembers
But I know people.,1,2,The North Remembers
And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.,1,2,The North Remembers
Joffrey is King.,1,2,The North Remembers
Joffrey is King.,1,2,The North Remembers
You are here to advise him.,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm only here to advise him.,1,2,The North Remembers
"And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.",1,2,The North Remembers
How?,1,2,The North Remembers
You love your children.,1,2,The North Remembers
It's your one redeeming quality.,1,2,The North Remembers
That and your cheekbones.,1,2,The North Remembers
The Starks love their children as well.,1,2,The North Remembers
And we have two of them.,1,2,The North Remembers
One.,1,2,The North Remembers
One?,1,2,The North Remembers
"Arya, little animal ... she disappeared.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?",1,2,The North Remembers
We had three Starks to trade.,1,2,The North Remembers
You chopped one's head off and let another escape.,1,2,The North Remembers
Father will be furious.,1,2,The North Remembers
It must be odd for you... to be the disappointing child.,1,2,The North Remembers
"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.",1,2,The North Remembers
The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter.,1,2,The North Remembers
"The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.",1,2,The North Remembers
"When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower",1,2,The North Remembers
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.,1,2,The North Remembers
Men worked back then.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.",1,2,The North Remembers
At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.,1,2,The North Remembers
And the Gods forbid it rains.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.",1,2,The North Remembers
Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.",1,2,The North Remembers
King Robb. And it's not his war.,1,2,The North Remembers
He didn't choose it.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners and took the men.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Do you remember your vows, Ser?",1,2,The North Remembers
Of course I remember!,1,2,The North Remembers
"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord.",1,2,The North Remembers
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?,1,2,The North Remembers
I ... I believe it will.,1,2,The North Remembers
"We didn't want him here all day, did we?",1,2,The North Remembers
I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.,1,2,The North Remembers
Nor did I.,1,2,The North Remembers
But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.,1,2,The North Remembers
Lord Portan.,1,2,The North Remembers
"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.",1,2,The North Remembers
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.,1,2,The North Remembers
Makes all your pain go away.,1,2,The North Remembers
Don't have any pain.,1,2,The North Remembers
Lucky for you.,1,2,The North Remembers
That way.,1,2,The North Remembers
You've been having those dreams again.,1,2,The North Remembers
I don't dream.,1,2,The North Remembers
Everyone dreams.,1,2,The North Remembers
I don't.,1,2,The North Remembers
Heard some of the men talking about the comet.,1,2,The North Remembers
They say it's an omen.,1,2,The North Remembers
They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.,1,2,The North Remembers
Did they?,1,2,The North Remembers
I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.,1,2,The North Remembers
Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.,1,2,The North Remembers
Heard a stableboy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father.,1,2,The North Remembers
The stars don't fall for men.,1,2,The North Remembers
"The red comet means one thing, boy ... dragons.",1,2,The North Remembers
The dragons are all dead.,1,2,The North Remembers
They've been dead for centuries.,1,2,The North Remembers
Mmm.,1,2,The North Remembers
Mmm. Mmm.,1,2,The North Remembers
"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?",1,2,The North Remembers
He said they ate meat.,1,2,The North Remembers
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?,1,2,The North Remembers
My brother didn't know anything about dragons.,1,2,The North Remembers
He didn't know anything about anything.,1,2,The North Remembers
Eh.,1,2,The North Remembers
She was Drogo's first gift to me.,1,2,The North Remembers
I remember.,1,2,The North Remembers
I promised to protect them.,1,2,The North Remembers
Promised them their enemies would die screaming.,1,2,The North Remembers
How do I make starvation scream?,1,2,The North Remembers
"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.",1,2,The North Remembers
Does it ever end?,1,2,The North Remembers
This is farther east than I've ever been.,1,2,The North Remembers
"But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.",1,2,The North Remembers
And you're sure there's no other way?,1,2,The North Remembers
"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.",1,2,The North Remembers
"If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.",1,2,The North Remembers
No one will take my dragons.,1,2,The North Remembers
"They are too weak to fight, as are your people.",1,2,The North Remembers
You must be their strength.,1,2,The North Remembers
As you are mine.,1,2,The North Remembers
Rakharo...,1,2,The North Remembers
You never have.,1,2,The North Remembers
This is bad time to start.,1,2,The North Remembers
Having a rough time of it?,1,2,The North Remembers
Nothing's killed me yet.,1,2,The North Remembers
Your ass killed the sledge.,1,2,The North Remembers
You offered me a ride.,1,2,The North Remembers
I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.,1,2,The North Remembers
I was born in a place like this.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Later, I fell on hard times.",1,2,The North Remembers
Are those girls?,1,2,The North Remembers
Craster's daughters.,1,2,The North Remembers
I haven't seen a girl in six months.,1,2,The North Remembers
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.,1,2,The North Remembers
"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?",1,2,The North Remembers
He don't like people messing with his wives.,1,2,The North Remembers
"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.",1,2,The North Remembers
And on and on it goes.,1,2,The North Remembers
That's foul.,1,2,The North Remembers
It's beyond foul.,1,2,The North Remembers
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.,1,2,The North Remembers
Craster's still here.,1,2,The North Remembers
He must be doing something right.,1,2,The North Remembers
What happens to the boys?,1,2,The North Remembers
Hmm?,1,2,The North Remembers
He marries his daughters.,1,2,The North Remembers
What does he do with his sons?,1,2,The North Remembers
He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.,1,2,The North Remembers
People make all sorts of plans.,1,2,The North Remembers
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.,1,2,The North Remembers
Haven't missed him.,1,2,The North Remembers
Always treated me like scum.,1,2,The North Remembers
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.,1,2,The North Remembers
"You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.",1,2,The North Remembers
We're not Southerners.,1,2,The North Remembers
Who's this little girl?,1,2,The North Remembers
You're prettier than half my daughters.,1,2,The North Remembers
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?,1,2,The North Remembers
What's your name?,1,2,The North Remembers
Jon Snow.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Snow, eh?",1,2,The North Remembers
"Listen to me, b*st*rd.",1,2,The North Remembers
"All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners.",1,2,The North Remembers
"But now you're in the North, the real North.",1,2,The North Remembers
The lad meant no harm.,1,2,The North Remembers
I catch that pretty little b*st*rd talking to my daughters ... ,1,2,The North Remembers
"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Now, sit down and shut your mouth.",1,2,The North Remembers
You bring any of that good wine with you?,1,2,The North Remembers
We did.,1,2,The North Remembers
We passed through six villages on the way here.,1,2,The North Remembers
All six were abandoned.,1,2,The North Remembers
Where have all the wildlings gone?,1,2,The North Remembers
"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.",1,2,The North Remembers
There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.,1,2,The North Remembers
Bring it in here.,1,2,The North Remembers
" Yes, commander.",1,2,The North Remembers
You want to know where they've all gone?,1,2,The North Remembers
North... to join up with Mance Rayder...,1,2,The North Remembers
Your old friend.,1,2,The North Remembers
He's no friend of mine.,1,2,The North Remembers
"He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Oh, aye.",1,2,The North Remembers
But once he was just a poor black crow.,1,2,The North Remembers
And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.,1,2,The North Remembers
He's been calling himself that for years.,1,2,The North Remembers
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?,1,2,The North Remembers
That's a good-looking axe.,1,2,The North Remembers
Fresh forged?,1,2,The North Remembers
Give it here.,1,2,The North Remembers
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.,1,2,The North Remembers
Here.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Oh, that's some lovely steel.",1,2,The North Remembers
You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?,1,2,The North Remembers
Gathering an army.,1,2,The North Remembers
"What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your",1,2,The North Remembers
southern kings.,1,2,The North Remembers
And where does he plan marching this army?,1,2,The North Remembers
"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.",1,2,The North Remembers
These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.,1,2,The North Remembers
The cold winds are rising.,1,2,The North Remembers
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.,1,2,The North Remembers
Wife... tell the Lord Crow how content we are.,1,2,The North Remembers
This is our place.,1,2,The North Remembers
Our husband keeps us safe.,1,2,The North Remembers
Better to live free than die a slave.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?",1,2,The North Remembers
We chose different paths.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it.",1,2,The North Remembers
"You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.",1,2,The North Remembers
A roof would be welcome.,1,2,The North Remembers
It's been hard riding.,1,2,The North Remembers
We've brought our own food and good steel for you.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.",1,2,The North Remembers
"And I see this one staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Your roof, your rules.",1,2,The North Remembers
Who am I?!,1,2,The North Remembers
Who am I?!,1,2,The North Remembers
Lord commander.,1,2,The North Remembers
And who are you?,1,2,The North Remembers
Jon Snow.,1,2,The North Remembers
Who are you?,1,2,The North Remembers
Your steward.,1,2,The North Remembers
You want to lead one day?,1,2,The North Remembers
Then learn how to follow.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.",1,2,The North Remembers
We offer you these false Gods.,1,2,The North Remembers
Take them and cast your light upon us...,1,2,The North Remembers
For the night is dark and full of terrors.,1,2,The North Remembers
For the night is dark and full of terrors.,1,2,The North Remembers
"After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world.",1,2,The North Remembers
The stars will bleed.,1,2,The North Remembers
We need to stop her.,1,2,The North Remembers
The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas...,1,2,The North Remembers
Not now.,1,2,The North Remembers
...And the dead shall rise in the North.,1,2,The North Remembers
All you men were named in the Light of the Seven!,1,2,The North Remembers
Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers?,1,2,The North Remembers
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?,1,2,The North Remembers
You smell of fear ... fear and piss and old bones.,1,2,The North Remembers
Do you want to stop me?,1,2,The North Remembers
Stop me.,1,2,The North Remembers
"In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.",1,2,The North Remembers
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Lord, cast your light upon us!",1,2,The North Remembers
For the night is dark and full of terrors.,1,2,The North Remembers
For the night is dark and full of terror.,1,2,The North Remembers
This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.,1,2,The North Remembers
Stannis is our king.,1,2,The North Remembers
"We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.",1,2,The North Remembers
King.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.",1,2,The North Remembers
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.,1,2,The North Remembers
"As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths.",1,2,The North Remembers
"He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos.",1,2,The North Remembers
If you tell him the truth...,1,2,The North Remembers
What's the truth?,1,2,The North Remembers
"""And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved",1,2,The North Remembers
"brother Robert ... "" he wasn't my beloved brother.",1,2,The North Remembers
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.,1,2,The North Remembers
"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.",1,2,The North Remembers
A lie. Take it out.,1,2,The North Remembers
"""...that my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister.",1,2,The North Remembers
"By right of birth ... """,1,2,The North Remembers
"Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.",1,2,The North Remembers
Call him what he is.,1,2,The North Remembers
"""...And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.",1,2,The North Remembers
"By right of birth and blood, i do this day lay claim ... """,1,2,The North Remembers
"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.",1,2,The North Remembers
"""Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.",1,2,The North Remembers
"By right of birth and blood,",1,2,The North Remembers
I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Let all true men declare their loyalty.""",1,2,The North Remembers
"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me.",1,2,The North Remembers
I'll not make the same mistake.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.",1,2,The North Remembers
The time has come to choose.,1,2,The North Remembers
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Your Grace,the Lannisters are the true enemy.",1,2,The North Remembers
"If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother ... ",1,2,The North Remembers
I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Well, many have already declared for him ... ",1,2,The North Remembers
"Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.",1,2,The North Remembers
Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.,1,2,The North Remembers
The Lord of Light stands behind him.,1,2,The North Remembers
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?,1,2,The North Remembers
He has no need for ships.,1,2,The North Remembers
"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war.",1,2,The North Remembers
"If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.",1,2,The North Remembers
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.,1,2,The North Remembers
"I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know,",1,2,The North Remembers
Ser Davos.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.",1,2,The North Remembers
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.,1,2,The North Remembers
"I owe you an apology, my King.",1,2,The North Remembers
My duty is to serve.,1,2,The North Remembers
You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods.,1,2,The North Remembers
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.,1,2,The North Remembers
Shall we drink together?,1,2,The North Remembers
Don't.,1,2,The North Remembers
A cup of wine to honor the one true God.,1,2,The North Remembers
"The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away.",1,2,The North Remembers
Your Grace.,1,2,The North Remembers
King in the North.,1,2,The North Remembers
"I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Have you grown fond of me, Stark?",1,2,The North Remembers
Is that it?,1,2,The North Remembers
I've never seen you with a girl.,1,2,The North Remembers

Smart boy.,1,2,The North Remembers
What's wrong?,1,2,The North Remembers
"Don't like being called ""boy""?",1,2,The North Remembers
Insulted?,1,2,The North Remembers
"You insult yourself, Kingslayer.",1,2,The North Remembers
You've been defeated by a boy.,1,2,The North Remembers
You're held captive by a boy.,1,2,The North Remembers
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.,1,2,The North Remembers
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros.,1,2,The North Remembers
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon.,1,2,The North Remembers
He's your b*st*rd son.,1,2,The North Remembers
"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.",1,2,The North Remembers
How convenient for him.,1,2,The North Remembers
My father learned the truth.,1,2,The North Remembers
That's why you had him executed.,1,2,The North Remembers
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.,1,2,The North Remembers
Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.,1,2,The North Remembers
And you ... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.,1,2,The North Remembers
You have proof?,1,2,The North Remembers
Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.,1,2,The North Remembers
You think my father's going to negotiate with you?,1,2,The North Remembers
You don't know him very well.,1,2,The North Remembers
"No, but he's starting to know me.",1,2,The North Remembers
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.,1,2,The North Remembers
It's better than three defeats.,1,2,The North Remembers
This city stinks...,1,2,The North Remembers
Like dead bodies.,1,2,The North Remembers
"A bit corpsey, yes.",1,2,The North Remembers
And sh1t.,1,2,The North Remembers
I thought you wanted to come here.,1,2,The North Remembers
I love it.,1,2,The North Remembers
You love the smell of dead bodies and sh1t?,1,2,The North Remembers
And cum and garlic and rum.,1,2,The North Remembers
You can smell cum from the balcony?,1,2,The North Remembers
I love the stink. I love the noise.,1,2,The North Remembers
Cities make me want to f*ck.,1,2,The North Remembers
And so did the country.,1,2,The North Remembers
This is where I belong.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Yes, well, you need to be careful.",1,2,The North Remembers
No one can know you're here.,1,2,The North Remembers
No one will know.,1,2,The North Remembers
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.,1,2,The North Remembers
"They're all liars ...  good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.",1,2,The North Remembers
What about you?,1,2,The North Remembers
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.,1,2,The North Remembers
Truth?,1,2,The North Remembers
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.,1,2,The North Remembers
Why do you think I am so little?,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.,1,2,The North Remembers
Oh!,1,2,The North Remembers
Ned Stark actually slept on this.,1,2,The North Remembers
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.,1,2,The North Remembers
One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.,1,2,The North Remembers
Lord Baelish.,1,2,The North Remembers
Your Grace.,1,2,The North Remembers
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Of course, Your Grace.",1,2,The North Remembers
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya ... we can't seem to locate her.,1,2,The North Remembers
"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.",1,2,The North Remembers
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.,1,2,The North Remembers
Curious.,1,2,The North Remembers
"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her ... well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Well, you could ask Varys where she is.",1,2,The North Remembers
He'll have an answer for you.,1,2,The North Remembers
Whether you believe it...,1,2,The North Remembers
"Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.",1,2,The North Remembers
Who knows what they want?,1,2,The North Remembers
A mockingbird.,1,2,The North Remembers
"You created your own Sigil, didn't you?",1,2,The North Remembers
Yes.,1,2,The North Remembers
Appropriate... for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm glad you like it.,1,2,The North Remembers
Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.,1,2,The North Remembers
Others have to find their own way.,1,2,The North Remembers
I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.,1,2,The North Remembers
He loved the eldest daughter.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Sadly, she had eyes for another.",1,2,The North Remembers
"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections.",1,2,The North Remembers
"And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family.",1,2,The North Remembers
"But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.",1,2,The North Remembers
And which truth is that?,1,2,The North Remembers
Knowledge is power.,1,2,The North Remembers
Seize him.,1,2,The North Remembers
Cut his throat.,1,2,The North Remembers
Stop. Wait.,1,2,The North Remembers
I've changed my mind. Let him go.,1,2,The North Remembers
Step back three paces.,1,2,The North Remembers
Turn around.,1,2,The North Remembers
Close your eyes.,1,2,The North Remembers
Power is power.,1,2,The North Remembers
Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me.,1,2,The North Remembers
I would very much appreciate it.,1,2,The North Remembers
You're Ser Alton Lannister?,1,2,The North Remembers
"I am, Your Grace.",1,2,The North Remembers
I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms.,1,2,The North Remembers
"First, your family must release my sisters.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.",1,2,The North Remembers
And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.,1,2,The North Remembers
Their families can honor them with proper funerals.,1,2,The North Remembers
"An honorable request, Your Grace.",1,2,The North Remembers
Third...,1,2,The North Remembers
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.,1,2,The North Remembers
"From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.",1,2,The North Remembers
The King in the North.,1,2,The North Remembers
King in the North.,1,2,The North Remembers
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.,1,2,The North Remembers
"If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.",1,2,The North Remembers

"If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace.",1,2,The North Remembers

I will litter the south with Lannister dead.,1,2,The North Remembers

"You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.",1,2,The North Remembers
That will be all for tonight.,1,2,The North Remembers
"A word, Your Grace?",1,2,The North Remembers
"You don't have to call me ""Your Grace"" when no one's around.",1,2,The North Remembers
It's not so bad once you get used to it.,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.,1,2,The North Remembers
"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?",1,2,The North Remembers
Of course they are.,1,2,The North Remembers
"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.",1,2,The North Remembers
And we can't take King's Landing without ships.,1,2,The North Remembers
My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.,1,2,The North Remembers
Men who fought my father.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now.",1,2,The North Remembers
I'm his only living son.,1,2,The North Remembers
He'll listen to me. I know he will.,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm not a Stark. I know that.,1,2,The North Remembers
But your father raised me to be an honorable man.,1,2,The North Remembers
We can avenge him together.,1,2,The North Remembers
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,1,2,The North Remembers
I need his ships. They say he has 200.,1,2,The North Remembers
They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.,1,2,The North Remembers
Shall we rally them to fight for us?,1,2,The North Remembers
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.,1,2,The North Remembers
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.,1,2,The North Remembers
Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.,1,2,The North Remembers
Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.,1,2,The North Remembers
"Before me, it was father.",1,2,The North Remembers
You married one rebel and mothered another.,1,2,The North Remembers
"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.",1,2,The North Remembers
"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.",1,2,The North Remembers
You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands?,1,2,The North Remembers
And Arya ... ,1,2,The North Remembers
I haven't heard a word about Arya.,1,2,The North Remembers
What are we fighting for if not for them?,1,2,The North Remembers
It's more complicated than that!,1,2,The North Remembers
You know it is.,1,2,The North Remembers
It's time for me to go home.,1,2,The North Remembers
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.,1,2,The North Remembers
You can't go to Winterfell.,1,2,The North Remembers
I beg your pardon?,1,2,The North Remembers
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.,1,2,The North Remembers
Why in the name of all the Gods ... because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.,1,2,The North Remembers
"He's rallied an army of 100,000.",1,2,The North Remembers
You know him. You know his family.,1,2,The North Remembers
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.,1,2,The North Remembers
You have a hundred other lords ... ,1,2,The North Remembers
Which of these lords do I trust more than you?,1,2,The North Remembers
"If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one.",1,2,The North Remembers
"When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace.",1,2,The North Remembers
We'll get the girls back.,1,2,The North Remembers
Then we'll all go home... for good.,1,2,The North Remembers
I will ride at first light.,1,2,The North Remembers
"We will all be together again soon, I promise.",1,2,The North Remembers
You've done so well.,1,2,The North Remembers
Your father would be... proud.,1,2,The North Remembers
Give Lord Renly my regards.,1,2,The North Remembers
King Renly.,1,2,The North Remembers
There's a king in every corner now.,1,2,The North Remembers
What is all this?,1,2,The North Remembers
Returning this room to its proper appearance.,1,2,The North Remembers
Say what you will about the Targaryens ... they were conquerors.,1,2,The North Remembers
That is a seat for a conqueror.,1,2,The North Remembers
"It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.",1,2,The North Remembers
We can't find Arya Stark.,1,2,The North Remembers
"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.",1,2,The North Remembers
"Perhaps. But if not, we need her.",1,2,The North Remembers
They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.,1,2,The North Remembers
I think they might. They're weak.,1,2,The North Remembers
They put too much value on their women.,1,2,The North Remembers
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.,1,2,The North Remembers
Send out as many men as we can.,1,2,The North Remembers
I'm sure if you asked grandfather ... ,1,2,The North Remembers
The King does not ask; He commands.,1,2,The North Remembers
And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.,1,2,The North Remembers
His life is in danger.,1,2,The North Remembers
We're at war.,1,2,The North Remembers
All our lives are in danger.,1,2,The North Remembers
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.,1,2,The North Remembers
And you.,1,2,The North Remembers
Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.,1,2,The North Remembers
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.,1,2,The North Remembers
Of course it is.,1,2,The North Remembers
No one believes this foul gossip.,1,2,The North Remembers
Someone believes it.,1,2,The North Remembers

"No, no, no, no.",1,2,The North Remembers

Because you're a smart gambler.,2,2,The Night Lands

The sea bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm to fight fishermen?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Be careful of their nets.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
He won't give up the North so easily.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
They won't even know we're there until it's too late.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"What do you know of it, woman?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm a proven warrior.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm not protecting anyone.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Rise up against them and they could destroy us.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
What are our words?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Our words?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"""We do not sow.""",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"""We do not sow.""",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We are Ironborn.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We take what is ours.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your time with the wolves has made you weak.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You act as if I volunteered to go.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"You gave me away, if you remember.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
After he crushed you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Did you take what was yours then?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You gave me away!,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your boy!,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your last boy!,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And now you curse me because I've come home.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You'd have our father bow down to your other family?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I have no other family.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Don't you?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Our ships sail with or without you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You won't let me leave this room.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You won't let me ... ,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Shh, shh, keep your voice down.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Why? You think your father can hear me?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
He's 300 miles away!,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
( Sighs ),3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I don't intend for you to stay here.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Again, only temporary.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
But you wouldn't be a cook.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You'd pose as a scullion.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Scullion? What is a scullion?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Kitchen wench.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
A kitchen wench?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Yes, but ... ",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Cleaning pots?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Is that how my lion wants to see me?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your lion wants to see you alive.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We've come to a dangerous place.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
My sister wants to hurt me.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
She'll look for any weakness she can find.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
She can't know about you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm the weakness?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"It's a compliment, My Lady.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
How is being a weakness a compliment?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Language can be a bit tricky here.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Oh, I'm too stupid to understand.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
The stupid foreign girl.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I am not a kitchen wench.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Soon, darling, when the war is over.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
But yours will be ivory since you're the bride.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
The Princess just spoke to you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Pardon, Your Grace.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the Gods.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
He might.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Would you like that?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
No. I don't think so.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

"I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You're not from here.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
No.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
What are you doing?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You should just do them.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
What things?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
No.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You said to brush ... ,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Not now.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your chamber pot is empty.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Clean the table.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Yes.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
For whom?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Lady Zuriff.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Lady Zuriff?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Lady Zuriff.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
She wasn't in this city.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Well, I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"And I don't have time to answer 1,000 questions and teach you how to do your job.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Do you want me to leave?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Just brush my hair.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Oh, thank the Gods.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I haven't had a proper sh1t in six days.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"I've encountered this problem before, My Lord.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Two drops with water daily.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Please.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Thank you, My Lord.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Why, yes, of course, My Lord.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
These are perilous times.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And the crown must forge new alliances.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Matrimony, huh?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Yes.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the queen mustn't know.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
There's too much at stake.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I shall be silent as the grave.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"But remember, the queen mustn't know.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Ooh, ""the queen mustn't know.""",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I love conversations that begin this way.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Theon Greyjoy?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Forgive me, My Lord,?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
He fights for Robb Stark.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
his father's ships.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"But remember, you must tell no one.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Tell no one what?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Lysa is not fond of me.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
She imprisoned you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
She tried to execute you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And you offer her son a princess?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Who better?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
What's in it for me?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Harrenhal is cursed.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Never took you for a superstitious man.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"By all means, tear it down and rebuild.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You'll be able to afford it.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You served my family well in the matter of the succession.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Until you snatched it away.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I didn't need Janos Slynt.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"It's settled, then?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Good.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Oh, and remember ... the queen mustn't know.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
( Breathing heavily ),3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
That must hurt.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
( Groans ),3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

What is it?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
( Scoffs ),3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
A member of the Kingsguard?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
( Sighs ),3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Brienne is a very capable warrior.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And she's devoted to me.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You're jealous.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Jealous?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Of Brienne the beauty?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Don't make me laugh.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'll make it up to you.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"No, Your Grace.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Not tonight.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
There's another Tyrell who requires your attention.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And Margaery's a virgin?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Officially.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Shall I bring her to you?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
As is your right. You are a King.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You look very beautiful.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Thank you, Your Grace.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
It's a lovely gown.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You think so?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I can't decide how I like it better.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
This way... or this way.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You certainly don't need it.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Although... some say that beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Must be the wine.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Here, let me.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
( Shudders ),3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I'm sorry.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Do you want my brother to come in and help?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
What?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
He could get you started.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I know he wouldn't mind.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I don't know what you're talking about.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
There's no need for us to play games.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Your enemies aren't happy about us.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
They want to tear us apart.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We can try again later.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"You decide how you want to do it ... with me, with me and Loras.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
However else you like.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Whatever you need to do.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You are a King.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Cersei: You monster.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Myrcella is my only daughter.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Myrcella's a Princess.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Some would say she was born for this.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Dorne is the safest place or her.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
That's why we need to seduce them.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
We're going to need their support in the war your son started.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
She'll be a hostage.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
A guest.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You won't get away with this.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"It's done, Cersei.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
No.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
You cannot stop it.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
No!,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Make no mistake.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Get out! Get out!,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned God?",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I would.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

"Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

And Harrenhal ... ,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I suppose that's off the table as well.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Leave me out of your next deception.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
I would see him released.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
That's where you come in.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"No, he won't. But his mother might.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

I am your loyal servant.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

It's a falsehood. I swear it.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
It wasn't me.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

It was Varys the spider.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the Gods.,3,2,What is Dead May Never Die
"He has a sword, the power of life and death.",3,2,What is Dead May Never Die

Wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Ready my horse. We leave at dawn.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Nothing to say?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Mercy! Mercy, My Lord!",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I want to know what Cersei is doing and you will tell me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Yes, My Lord, I will.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Sweet boy! Help us!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Round up any survivors.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
This one's a girl dressed as a boy.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I need a new cupbearer.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I will give you this one night to reconsider.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Otherwise I shall destroy you.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Look to your sins, Lord Renly.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The night is dark and full of terrors.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I will vouch for her, her people and her dragons.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Be it on your head.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What am I bringing ashore?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The red woman.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"♪ Game of Thrones 2x05 ♪ The Ghost of Harrenhal Original Air Date on April 29, 2012 ♪",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You swear it?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
By the mother.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Your son can go on calling himself King in the North, the Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And the wording of this oath?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And in return for my son's loyalty?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
In the morning I'll destroy my brother's army.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Negotiate a peace with your brother.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Negotiate with Stannis?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You heard him out there.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'd have better luck debating the wind.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Please bring my terms to your son.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I believe we are natural allies.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I hope he feels the same.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No. Follow me!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You'll die for this.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"No, wait, it wasn't her!",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You'll-.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"No, wa-",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We've got to leave.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They'll hang you for this.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"- Inside the King's tent, go!",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Now!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I won't leave him.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You can't avenge him if you're dead.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Over there, go!",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Not that way.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We need to go home.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Loras.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"My Lord, My Lady.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Get out.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stannis will be here in an hour.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And you want that privilege for yourself.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
There's no time for this.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Ride back to Highgarden, sister.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm not running from Stannis.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I don't believe that. You don't believe that.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Who gained the most from our king's death?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stannis.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I will put a sword through his righteous face.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You can't stay here.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He would have been a true king, a good king.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Revenge.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You can't avenge him from the grave.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Bring the horses.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Please.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He was very handsome.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He was, Your Grace.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"""Your Grace.""",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Do you want to be a queen?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I want to be the queen.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Killed? By whom?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Accounts differ.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Really? Who'd have thought?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Whomever did it, I say well done.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's not what Varys says.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And I say father raised you to have too much respect for money.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
She'll be safer in Dorne.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It so happens that I am.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
So clever.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Schemes and plots are the same thing.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They are going to attack us.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We need to be ready.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No need to concern yourself over it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The King is taking personal charge of siege preparations.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
May I ask specifically what the King has in mind?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You may specifically or you may ask vaguely.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The answer will be the same.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's important that we talk about this.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's the King's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's wildfire.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Wildfire?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That's a lie right there.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"When I tell him you're f*cking her, I mean.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm telling you the truth.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The smart money would be on more likely.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
She's making wildfire.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The alchemists' guild is being commissioned.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I suppose there's only one way to find out.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They are planning to launch them from the city walls into Stannis's ships and armies.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Please.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
When did she tell you this?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I heard her talking with the Pyromancer.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And the other night after I left her, she went to meet him.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I swear to you.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Swear to me on what?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
On my life.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
But I don't care about your life.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"In the Light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow ... ",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"All right, all right. Enough.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Even torturing you is boring.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Just get out.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It will be my pleasure.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your Grace.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What is it?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your Grace.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your Grace.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Fools love a fool.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your Grace.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I grieve for him as well ... for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Your Grace, I ... ",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And I've never known you to hide from the truth.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You've come to lecture me on truth?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've come to tell you that what I saw ... ,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
All my brother's bannermen have come to my side.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They won't be able to resist us now.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron ... ",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'll hear no more about it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
When do we sail for King's Landing?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That's not your concern.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Loyal service means telling hard truths.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Oh, truth again.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"All right, what's the truth?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The hard truth?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What do you believe?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You won those bannermen from Renly.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Don't lose them to her.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The other lords won't be happy.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've got it!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've got it!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"So it's that one there at the top, on the right.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Buy my fruit, My Lord. Fresh fruit.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What do we have?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What about your father?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's very busy.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Corruption, yes.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"We are swollen, bloated, foul.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of Kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Yes, a rotten king.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's hard to argue with his assessment.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Not after what he did to your birthday present.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The King is a lost cause.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You have to admire his imagination.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's talking about you.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Demon monkey?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
People think you're pulling the King's strings.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They blame you for the city's ills.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You don't need to convince me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Demon monkey.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
( Seagulls screeching,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Yeah, come on.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You're the crew of the sea bitch?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm your commander. Welcome.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stop.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stop!,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your Captain commands you to stop.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Where are we heading, Captain?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Stony Shore to raid their villages.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I do.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Your Captain.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
All I need is a ship.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains, and hang you for a traitor.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stop. We yield.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Congratulations on your first command.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Oh, I'm not here for you.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Too narrow.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You'd better get out there.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Wouldn't want them to set sail without you.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That would never happen.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"This lot, though...",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Enjoy the Stony Shore.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Come on, I'll take you out.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Who are you?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Dagmer, your first mate.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Why aren't you with the rest of them?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That would be good for a laugh.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You're not.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They're all Iron Islanders.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The seat of the House of Tallhart ... a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"What, you don't think we could take it?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"No, we could.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We could never hold it for more than a few days.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And then ... take me to my ship.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Starks have overextended their lines.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Starks understand winter better than we ever will.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The cold won't beat them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Our spies report growing discontent among the northern lords.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
This is war; No one's content.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You've been waiting for him to fail.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He is not going to fail, not without our help.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
So how do we stop him?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"We've worked through the night, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"As I think you would, Reginald.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My wife's in Lannisport.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Well, then you'd better start riding.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Go before I change my mind and send her your head.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Not wine, water.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We'll be here for some time.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Girl.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Where are you from?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Maidenpool, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Remind me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"House Mooton, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And what is their Sigil?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A red salmon.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You're a northerner, aren't you?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Good. One more time, where are you from?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Barrowton, My Lord. House Dustin.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They call him the young wolf.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant Direwolf.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They say he can't be killed.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And do you believe them?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"No, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Anyone can be killed.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Fetch that water.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A girl says nothing.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A girl keeps her mouth closed.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A boy becomes a girl.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I was always a girl.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And I was always aware.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
But the girl keeps secrets.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It is not for a man to spoil them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You're one of them now.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I should have let you burn.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And you fetch water for one of them now.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I didn't have a choice.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You did. I did.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And here we are.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A man pays his debts.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A man owes three.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Three what?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And only death may pay for life.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You saved me and the two I was with.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You stole three deaths from the Red God.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We have to give them back.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Speak three names and the man will do the rest.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Three lives I will give you ... no more, no less, and we're done.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I can name anyone and you'll kill him?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A man has said.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The one who tortures everyone.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A man needs a name.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I don't know his name.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They call him the Tickler.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That is enough.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's not here yet.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He'd have seen us, blown the horn.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
When will he come?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Halfhand does things in his own time.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My uncle told me stories about him.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Most of them are true.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The whole winter.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Had to wait for the thaw.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Well, possible for the Halfhand.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Beautiful, isn't it?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Gilly would love it here.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal

About time you did something.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
At least you'll keep warm.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The fist of the First Men.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Think of how old this place is ... before the Targaryens defeated the Hendals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Before I die, please, stop talking.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"What do you think they were like, the First Men?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stupid.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I think they were afraid.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I think they came here to get away from something.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And I don't think it worked.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Wildlings?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
One blast is for rangers returning.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Wildlings is two blasts.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"One blast for friends, two for foes.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And three for White Walkers.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"It's been 1,000 years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"But if it's been 1,000 years, how do you know?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Well...,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I read it in a book.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Look.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's Qhorin Halfhand.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Aye, we'll live another day.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Hurrah.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Take care, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I remember reading an old sailor's proverb ... ,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"""piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.""",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It could well be true.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My companion takes issue.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig sh1t...,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No offense meant.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Our order does not deal in pig sh1t.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The substance is fire given form.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
To do what?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
How much do you have?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in 10, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"My Lord, this man is insulting.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Men die, men sh1t themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor c**ts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My friend remains unconvinced.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Well, he's not living anymore.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Men win wars, not magic tricks.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Our present count stands at 7,811, enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
This is a sh1t idea.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You'll be making it for me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Dracarys.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Dracarys.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Let him sleep, Doreah.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Yes, Khaleesi.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He loves you.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Thank you, my friend.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It is known.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos ... ,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You would look like a real princess in Xaro's ... ,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You should wear it, Khaleesi.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You are their guest.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It would be rude not to.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And you must visit the night market.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It sounds wonderful.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Meereens think they have a night market.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I will take you there myself.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Please excuse me for a moment.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What are they doing?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's not the only thing.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They're quite good at killing the better men.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Mother of Dragons.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A demonstration?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Take this gem. Look at it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Into its depths.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
So many facets.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Often more than once.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You're always welcome, Mother of Dragons.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My apologies.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What is the House of the Undying?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"It turns their lips blue and their minds soft ... so soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You watch over her.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Do I know you?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I know you.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Who are you?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm no one.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
But she is the Mother of Dragons.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
She needs true protectors now more than ever.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And fire is power.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It looked like Stannis.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
To me it just looked like...,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A shadow in the shape of a man.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
In the shape of Stannis.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Will you stay there long, My Lady?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"After that, I will leave for Winterfell.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My two youngest need me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've been away from them for far too long.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I never knew my mother.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm sorry.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's a bloody business.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What comes after is even harder.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, My Lady?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You mean to kill Stannis.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I swore a vow.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
But Stannis has a great army around him.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I'm as good as any of them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I should never have fled.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Renly's death was no fault of yours.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You served him bravely.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I only held him that once as he was dying.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He's gone, Brienne.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I do not know your son, My Lady... but I could serve you if you would have me.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You have courage.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"When the time comes, I will not hold you back.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal

I will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"And it's not just thieves, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"There's wolves in them hills now, more than I've ever seen.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They come down in the night and they kill my sheep.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"My three sons is away fighting for your brother, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I can't keep watch all day and all night.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My wife always prayed for more children.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"We'll look after them. Thank you, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And may the Gods bless you and yours.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Stop it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Good.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Hodor.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Hodor. Bran ... Lord Stark.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Torrhen's Square is under siege.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Might be Sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We have to help them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
200 decent men.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal

"Won't take long, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Southerners don't do well up here.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"So, what does it mean?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Ask your Maester Luwin.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's the one studying books all the time.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Must not mean anything, then",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You're lying.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You know what it means.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I never said I didn't.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You didn't give me an honest answer.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That's not the same as being a liar.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Well, it's not far off.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"In the Godswood, you told me you didn't dream.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Now who's a liar?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
What did you see in your dream?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Something bad?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Tell me, boy.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls... flooded the castle.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Drowned men were floating here in the yard.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Ser Rodrik was one of them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The sea is hundreds of miles away.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I know.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's just a stupid dream.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Osha.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the wall?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
There.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
 Where?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
On that Mountain.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I don't see very well.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
A fire.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
There's a fire.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time. to throw a party in our honor.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
How many wildlings have joined him?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"From what we can tell, all of them.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They're almost ready to make their move.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Where?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Somewhere safe.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Somewhere south.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Can't just march into their midst.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Mance was one of us once.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Now he's one of them.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's gonna teach them our way of doing things.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They'll hit us in force.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And they won't run away when we hit back.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined more like us.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"So we need to be more like them, do things their way.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And to do that...,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
We need to get rid of those lookouts.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It's not a job for 400 men.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I need to move fast and silent.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I've fought and killed a Wight.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
How many rangers can say that?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's the one?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Aye. You killed a Wight.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Craster?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, My Lord.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
It would be no trouble.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Go on.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"He's my advisor, my friend.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Unlikely.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I can almost always tell what a man wants.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And what about what a woman wants?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Much more complicated.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You, for example, what do you want?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Why?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Because I promised my Khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I want them because they're mine by right.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"Ah, a conqueror.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And how did you get all of this?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Did someone give it to you?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
No.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I come from nothing.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
So you wanted more than you had and you took it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"You're a conqueror, too. you're just less ambitious.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Mmm.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"What do you want, Xaro Zhoan Daxos?",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"At the gates of the city, you bled for me.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Why?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I will show you why.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The hardest steel does not make a mark.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
They all went home empty-handed.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The only thing that can open this door is this key.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And behind the door?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
And it can all be mine?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
All?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Let us say half.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies ... enough to go home.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
All I have to do?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Is marry me.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
That was a romantic proposal.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"I've already married once for love, but the Gods stole her from me.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I come from nothing.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
But marry me and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be Princes and Princesses.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
See?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
I have more ambition than you thought.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, first of your name.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Robert Baratheon is dead.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
If you cross the sea with an army you bought ... ,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Four false kings destroying the country.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The usurper is dead.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.",5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal
Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.,5,2,The Ghost Of Harrenhal

Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Do you want to be a queen?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I want to be the queen.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

A man has said.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The one who tortures everyone.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They call him the Tickler.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
More impressive prize than a few fisherman's daughters.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

Take me to my ship.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You were raised here under this roof.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
These people are your people.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He disrespected me in front of my men.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

He is worth more to you alive than dead.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The Starks will pay.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

 I'll do anything. Please!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"No, please, stop it!",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Ghost, stay with us.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Ghost!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
There goes your pet.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He's not a pet.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"You're right, he's not.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You can't tame a wild thing.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You can't trust a wild thing.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Ghost is different.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
So you think.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
And you'll never know them.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I said you can't.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We could do the same.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"No, we couldn't.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
This is their country.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"They know where to walk, where not to walk.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My father always said I'm of the North.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I wasn't joking.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Look around, boy.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
This look like home to you?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"You start thinking you know this place, it'll kill you.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You understand me?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"No, you don't.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We're at war.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We've always been at war.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We're fighting the North and it's not going anywhere.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The Watch has given you a great gift.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You only have one thing to give in return ... your life.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'll gladly give my life.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I don't want you to be glad about it.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"And know this, boy ... your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They'll never know what you've done.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They'll never know how you died.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"They won't even know your damn name, but they'll be alive because some nameless b*st*rd north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Now, do you understand me?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I do.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You're even dumber than you look.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night, make us feel like we've got a purpose.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Come on.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

My Lord?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Can you read?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

To the Starks of Winterfell!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

I see I overestimated you.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Leave us.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Put the book away, girl.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New

Lord Petyr Baelish.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Hmmm.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Give us the room.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

"Ah, the late king Renly.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Rather a short reign.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Murdered by a woman, I hear.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
So they say.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"There has been talk of other forces at work, dark forces.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Here.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

"Yes, she does.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne, against my grandson.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They did.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
More wine for Lord Baelish.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement ... ",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They have.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Pardon, My Lord.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It's only wine.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You would ride there yourself?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Tonight, with your leave.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'll have an answer by nightfall.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"That'll be all, girl.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
What else?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New

A girl.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A wildling.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We could question her.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You could.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
She won't answer.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

I gave you my name.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm Jon Snow.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You ought to burn them you killed.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We'd need a big fire for that.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Tell me, Ygritte, why do you want us to build a big fire?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Are there some more friends in the area?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Our boy here's already killed one dead man.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He can do it again if he has to.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
What waits beyond the pass?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

Qhorin Halfhand.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Tell me true.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"If not, they'd kill you slow.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We have no food for her.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Can't spare a man to watch her.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It needs to be done.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Want me to do it?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
No.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"No, I'll do it.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Come, brothers.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We'll leave him to it.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We'll meet you at the top.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

You don't need to do it.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Mance would take you. I know he would.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
There's secret ways.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The Crows would never catch us.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm as much a Crow as they are.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

Can't.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Someone might see the smoke.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

I want that for you.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

I saw you cry.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
So?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It seems a normal thing.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Is your little brother a prince?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
No.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

 This way.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

He makes everyone wait.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I already have a husband.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New

The Mother of Dragons!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Ah.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Here he comes.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Terrible dreams.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Ahem.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'll have them flogged in the square.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Thank you, My Lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"So, my little princess, what is it you want?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My birthright ... the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I cannot give you what I do not have.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm asking you for ships.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I need my ships as well.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Retake?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My father sat there before he was murdered.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I didn't come here to argue grammar.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Of course not. You came to take my ships.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"So let me explain my position, little princess.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I make my living by trade.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
And I judge every trade on its merits.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You ask for ships.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You say I shall be repaid triple.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Do you have an army?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Not yet.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You do not have an army.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
There are many there that support my claim.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
When were you there last?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I left when I was a baby.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"So, in truth, you have no allies.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The people will rise to fight for their rightful Queen when I return.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Ah.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Now if you'll pardon me.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
For my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He believed ...  the world believed ...  that the ages had turned them to stone.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Do you understand?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm no ordinary woman.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My dreams come true.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I admire your passion.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"I'm sorry, little princess.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I am not your little princess.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria and I will take what is mine.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"With fire and blood, I will take it.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Yes, My Lady, but not with my ships.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Who taught you to read?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"My father, My Lord.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Hmm.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I taught my son Jaime to read.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"The Maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He couldn't make sense of the letters.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He reversed them in his head.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The Maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Ha!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"He hated me for it, for a time.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"For a long time, but he learned.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Where is your father? Is he alive?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Who was he?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A stonemason.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A stonemason who could read?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Hmm.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He taught himself.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Quite a man.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
What killed him?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Loyalty.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Did...,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Forgive me, My Lord. I shouldn't ask questions.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
No...,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
But you've already begun.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Did you know your father, My Lord?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I did.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I grew up with him.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I watched him grow old.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He loved us.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"He was a good man, but a weak man, a weak man who nearly destroyed our House and name.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm cold.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, My Lord.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Mmm.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Where are you going, girl?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"The armory, My Lord.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Why?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Lord Tywin sent me.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
What might this be?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Lord Tywin gave it to me.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
What for?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
To take to the armory.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Why would he do that?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Let's go and ask him.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Move!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Get out of the way!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Amory Lorch.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A girl has named a second name.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A man will do what must be done.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Now!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It has to be now.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Guard!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your Grace.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your Grace.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"My honor, Your Grace.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your Grace.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your Grace.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Quent.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Lady Talisa.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your Grace.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm not sure I'm a lady.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
It's hard to keep all the rules straight.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady unless she's a queen or a princess.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I could find someone who knows.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Because it's obvious.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"What if I told you my father sold lace on the long bridge and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'd call you a liar.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Better at amputations, I'm afraid.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Quite a pretty spot.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Will we be here long?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm not a spy.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Of course a spy would deny being a spy.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You're right. You've found me out.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"""The young wolf is on the move.""",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Perhaps you'd join me...,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"If you've got time, of course, for, well...",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Robb.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Mother.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Mother, this is Lady Talisa.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
She's been helping with the wounded.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
She's been very... helpful.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Lady Talisa.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Lady Stark.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Lady Talisa...?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Maegyr.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Maegyr?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Forgive me, I do not know this name.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Excuse me, My Lady. Your Grace.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I've missed you.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Yes, you look positively forlorn.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"You surprised me, that's all.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I didn't think I'd see you today.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I know.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You have inherited your father's responsibilities.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm afraid they come at a cost.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I know.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You are promised to another ... a debt that must be paid.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I haven't forgotten.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your Grace.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My Lady. News from Winterfell.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Your brothers desert you?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I can tell you which way to go.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We'll stop here.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Too dark to go any farther today.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Here? There's no shelter here.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
There's no shelter anywhere.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
There is if you know where to look.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
The cold could kill us both.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
If you light a fire ... ,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
No fire.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
But a fire is ... ,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
No fire.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Have it your way.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Bet you freeze to death before I do.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Bet your life.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Think they're out looking for you?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Yes.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Think they'll find you?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Yes.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You're brave.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Stupid, but brave.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We start again at first light. Get some sleep.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Stop moving.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm just trying to get comfortable.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Stop it!,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You're still moving.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Was I?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I didn't notice that time.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
This cannot be true.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm afraid it is true.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Why? Why would Theon ... ,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My brothers?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We've heard nothing of them.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I must go North at once.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"There's still a war to win, Your Grace.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
How can I ask men to follow me if I can't ... ,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
You are a king.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Let me go and talk to Theon.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
There will be no talk. He will die for this.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Let me send word to my b*st*rd at the Dreadfort.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
We have the Lannisters on the run.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
And Theon ... I want him brought to me alive.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
And then I'll take his head myself.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I'm no liar.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I done what I had to do to stay alive.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
I hate the Starks as well as you do.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"Let me serve you, My Lord.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"There are other ways to serve, My Lord.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well ... ",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"There are other ways to serve, my prince.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New
Like what?,6,2,The Old Gods And The New
"We know things, the Free people.",6,2,The Old Gods And The New

"No one has forgotten, Your Grace.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
No? Robert did.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Renly never fought a day in his life.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
He was only a boy.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
First we ate the horses.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

"The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
And then you made it through the lines.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I was relieved they did not.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"Insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
But now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

"A brave choice, Your Grace.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
They say Stannis never smiles.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Imagine Stannis's terror.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I am trying.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
You're an intelligent man.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

My sister became queen at the age of 19.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

And all the sh1t found its way to the sea.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I never expected to have any real power.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

"You're quite good at being Hand, you know?",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men, honorable men, but they disdained the game and those who played.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
You enjoy the game.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

Last thing I expected.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
And you play it well.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I'd like to keep playing it.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Astapor?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
We cannot stay here.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
They have my dragons.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
A mother does not flee without her children.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
They're not your children.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
You know I would die for you.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I will never abandon you.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

You saw me step into the fire.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Do you remember?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Until my last breath I will remember.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
After I have forgotten my mother's face.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
They are my children.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
And they are the only children I will ever have.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Take me to them.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
We should bury them.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Sends a message.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
As you say.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
What's this?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Gold for the farmer.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
For his trouble.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
His troubles are done.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
He's feeding the crops now.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"His wife, too.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
You're right... so far.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Who was that out there hung up the gates?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
Must have been the farmer's boys.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
"Shh, shh, shh.",8,2,The Prince of Winterfell
They mustn't know.,8,2,The Prince of Winterfell

King Stannis is my God. He raised me up and gave you a future I could never have imagined.,9,2,Blackwater
And you think a Fire God commanded all that?,9,2,Blackwater
It was Stannis.,9,2,Blackwater
"Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.",9,2,Blackwater
Don't tell him that.,9,2,Blackwater
Does it give you joy to scare people?,9,2,Blackwater
"No, it gives me joy to kill people.",9,2,Blackwater
Killing's the sweetest thing there is.,9,2,Blackwater
You shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.,9,2,Blackwater
He needs to be out there.,9,2,Blackwater
The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.,9,2,Blackwater
Stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.,9,2,Blackwater
Scouts assure us Robb Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.,9,2,Blackwater
He'll risk anything at any time.,9,2,Blackwater
We'll ride at nightfall.,9,2,Blackwater
The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.,9,2,Blackwater
"My dear nephew, you do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?",9,2,Blackwater
They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile.,9,2,Blackwater
"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.",9,2,Blackwater
Will it hold?,9,2,Blackwater
"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.",9,2,Blackwater
Stannis knows King's Landing.,9,2,Blackwater
He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest.,9,2,Blackwater

Pod.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Pod!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Find Bronn or Varys.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Tell them I am very much alive.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Yes, My Lord.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Would you like something for the pain?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What happened?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Where am I?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
These are your new chambers.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You are no longer Hand of the King.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Oh.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
For your trouble.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather Tywin Lannister the savior of the city and the Hand of the King.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Thank you, Your Grace.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal...",10,2,Valar Morghulis
With all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Ser Loras Tyrell.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Your House has come to our aid.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If your family would ask anything of me, ask it and it shall be yours.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before...",10,2,Valar Morghulis
She remains innocent.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our Houses.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"With all my heart, Your Grace.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I have come to love you from afar.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Well, I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, My Lady. ",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
A King must keep his word.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you... to set Sansa Stark aside.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Margaery!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We want Margaery!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Your Grace, the Gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the Gods.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The Gods are good.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I am free to heed my heart.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will be my Queen and I will love you from this day until my last day.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
My Lady.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
My sincerest condolences.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They're right ... I'm not good enough for him.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You shouldn't say that.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You'll be good enough for many things.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He'll still enjoy beating you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
But if he's not marrying me ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He'll let you go home?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I can see so much of her in you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
She was like a sister to me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"For her sake, I'll help get you home.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
King's Landing is my home now.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Look around you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We're all liars here.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And every one of us is better than you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Come in.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Make yourself comfortable.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That doesn't look very comfortable.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Here, watch me.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"No need for that, my dear.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You sure?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Most men like what they see.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm not like most men.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That's what most men say.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Have we met?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You wouldn't remember me if we had?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I meet a lot of men.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And I think you remember all of them.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I think your true talents are wasted on them.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"You're very kind, My Lord.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Allow me to return the favor.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You're afraid.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I know who you are.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
How do you know about that?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I thought you said you knew who I was.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I see a potential partner.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm afraid of him.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Oh, you should be.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
He's a dangerous man.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
But everyone has their weaknesses.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"You're a virgin, I take it?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Walk.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Childhood must have been awful for you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"They laughed at you, called you names?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Some boys like a challenge.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
One or two must have tried to get inside big Brienne.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
One or two tried.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Ah.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
But you fought them off.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
But none of them were strong enough.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm strong enough.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Not interested.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Of course you are.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Ah. ""They lay with lions.""",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Tavern girls, I'd say.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Probably served my father's soldiers.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That's how they earned this.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The glorious work of the northern freedom fighters.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What are you doing?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Burying them.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I think these women would understand if ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't care what you think.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I didn't leave it here.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Untie me now.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"So unless it got stuck in your ass on its way to your c**t, it stands to reason that it's gone ... whoa!",10,2,Valar Morghulis
What's your business here?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Traveling a prisoner.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You're a woman. A woman!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Well, f*ck me!",10,2,Valar Morghulis
If you've quite finished up ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"All right, we'll be going.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Whoa, whoa.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Who do you fight for?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The Starks.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What did he do?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"No, stealing is a crime.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Where are you taking him?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
To Riverrun.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Why Riverrun?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Why not kill him?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
For stealing a pig?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't give the orders.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He must be important to someone.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Sending him with you? How important could he be?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"All right, have it your way, m'lady.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Do I know you?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Have you been to Ashemark?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
No.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Then you don't know me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Is it near Ashemark?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
No.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I've never been there.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What do you think of these beauties?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I hope you gave them quick deaths.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Two of them we did, yeah.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Wait.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I do know you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That's Jaime Lannister.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I wish someone had told me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the King.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I have a question for you both.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And I want you to answer it at the same time.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I count to three, you both answer.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
What's his name?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
One.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Two. Three.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Two quick deaths.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Those were Stark men.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't serve the Starks.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I serve Lady Catelyn.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I told her I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Stay.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I know that.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And you mean to do it anyway?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I love her.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I know that seems important to you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It is important to me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Your father didn't love me when we married.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He hardly knew me or I him.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Love didn't just happen to us.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
It lasts longer.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Why not?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Because she's not beautiful?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Because she's not exotic and exciting?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And you agreed to it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You gave him your word.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
If your father lived his life for one thing ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
My father is dead.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You said you saw my victory in the flames.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I did.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I still see it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The flames lied.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a Fire God.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I fought for your God in Blackwater Bay.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You claimed to speak for a God.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You talk about war as if you understand it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I've been fighting far longer than you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Have you? Show me how you fight.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Show me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Where's your God now?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Will he save you?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Where is your God?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Inside you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I murdered my brother.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We murdered him.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Share the weight with me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He wasn't your brother.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
This war has just begun.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It will last for years.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Thousands will die at your command.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will betray the men serving you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will betray your family.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will betray everything you once held dear.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You are the Warrior of Light.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will be King.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"You promise these things, but... you don't know.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
None of us know.,10,2,Valar Morghulis

Look.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I see fire.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Keep looking.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Do you see?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Do you see, my King?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Yes.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I will kill that man.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing c**t before I fall.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
They want you to know you're surrounded.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I know I'm surrounded.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They don't want you to sleep.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They want to sap your spirit before ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Thank you, wise bald man.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
No word from my father?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
No.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Send more ravens.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You killed all the ravens.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The first time I saw Winterfell...,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"The first time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I saw it and I thought,",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"""of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"We never stood a chance against a man who lives here.""",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You love reminding me of that.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Everyone in this frozen pile of sh1t has always loved reminding me of that.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
To be told how much you owe them?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And then to go back home to your real father...,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I will kill that man.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I swear it to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every f*cking God in every f*cking heaven, I will kill that man.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Theon, listen to me.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I serve Winterfell.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Now Winterfell is yours.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm bound by oath to serve you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Run.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
500 Northmen wait outside the walls.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You have 20 men.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You can't win.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Wait for nightfall and run.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
There's nowhere to run.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
The Greyjoy who ran.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The shame of the family.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Don't go home.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Join the Night's Watch.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Once a man has taken the Black... he's beyond reach of the law.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
All his past crimes are forgiven.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I won't make it to the Wall.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
There are ways.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The road will be dangerous.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"But with a little luck... the Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You'll have opportunities there.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I've done a lot, haven't I?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Things I never imagined myself doing.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You're not the man you're pretending to be.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Not yet.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You may be right.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You hear that?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That's the mating call of the Northmen.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They want to f*ck us.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Well, I haven't had a good f*ck in weeks.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm ready for one.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You think they're right?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"We die today, brothers.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Every man, woman, and child will know who we were and how long we stood.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aggar and Gelmarr;,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Wex and Urzen;,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Stygg and Black Lorren ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Mothers will name their sons for us.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And whoever kills that f*cking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What is dead may never die!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What is dead may never die!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Ah!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Thought he'd never shut up.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It was a good speech.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Didn't want to interrupt.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What is this?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What are you doing?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Let's go home.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Come on.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Why should I believe you?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Why would I lie about it?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
To create strife between my sister and me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Where before there was nothing but love.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If it weren't for your Squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Pod.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Yes, My Lord?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"No, My Lord.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You're a good lad.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal Gold Cloaks outside my door at all times.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It varies from cloak to cloak.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Then my hill tribesmen.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Have gone home.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Your father paid them quite handsomely.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, My Lord.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And I thought we were friends.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We are.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Podrick, would you mind?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"The King won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Come along now, Podrick.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
My love.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It was good of you to come.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Good of me?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Of course I come.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I want to see you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Believe me, you don't.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Have you looked?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I will be the first.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Well?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You are a mess.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You should charge me double.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You think I'm here for money?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That was the arrangement we made.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I pay you and you lie to me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Aw, I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
f*ck your money.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Let's leave.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Leave?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Leave King's Landing.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They tried to kill you. They will try again.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Going into wars, fighting soldiers ... you're terrible at this.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You don't belong here.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What would we do in Pentos?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Eat, drink, f*ck, live.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I want to go with you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
So do it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Forget about them. Come with me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I can't.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I do belong here.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
These bad people are what I'm good at.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Outtalking them, outthinking them.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
It's what I am.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And I like it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I like it more than anything I've ever done.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Are you going to leave?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You have a sh1t memory.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I am yours and you are mine.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Look upon one another and say the words.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Father, smith, warrior, mother, maiden, crone, stranger...",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I am hers and she is mine...,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I am his and he is mine... from this day until the end of my days.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Is this a riddle?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Khaleesi!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Khaleesi!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Khaleesi!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You want me? Here I am.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Are you afraid of a little girl?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
How did he find us?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What are you doing here?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Waiting for you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
How did you know we'd come this way?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"After all the things you have seen, this is your question?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
How did you kill those guards?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Was it hard?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
No harder than taking a new name if you know the way.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If you would learn, you must come with me.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Where?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
My dancing master was from Braavos.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man ... that is something else entirely.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
A girl has many names on her lips ... ,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, Ilyn Payne, the Hound.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Names to offer up to the Red God.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
She could offer them all one by one.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I want to.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
But I can't.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I need to find my brother and mother.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And my sister.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I need to find her, too.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Then we must part.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
A man has duties as well.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Here.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What is it?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
A coin of great value.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Could it buy a horse?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It is not meant for the buying of horses.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Then what good is it?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him,",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"""Valar Morghulis.""",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Valar Morghulis.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Please don't go, Jaqen.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Jaqen is dead.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Say it again. Valar Morghulis.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Valar Morghulis.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Good.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Farewell, Arya Stark.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Osha, what are you doing?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We'll make you better.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I feel just fine.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They burned it down. They burned everything.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Not everything. Not you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
But they may come back. You have to go.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Put on your warmest clothes.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
North's the wrong way.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Their mother and brother are south.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We don't know where.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
There are too many enemies in the South.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Go to the Wall to Jon.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't want to leave you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
No more than I want to leave you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I pulled you into the world.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Both of you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I've seen both your faces almost every day since.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Go now with Hodor.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Go on.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'll be right here.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Hodor.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Osha.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You must protect them.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You're the only one who can.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You may have to protect them against your own kind.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I've got no great love for my own kind.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I'll get you milk of the poppy.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Tell me where to find it.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I don't want milk of the poppy.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Do it quickly.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
They miss their mother.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They want to be with you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Do you want to be with them?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You will be.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"When your dragons were born, our magic was born again.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
It is strongest in their presence.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And they are strongest in yours.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"You will be with them, through winter, summer, and winter again.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Across a thousand thousand seasons you will be with them.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And we will be with you until time comes to an end.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
This is not my home.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
My home is across the sea where my people are waiting for me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They will be waiting a long time.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Dracarys.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We should be there by sundown.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Won't be a fun night for you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Mance knows how to make crows sing.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Not talking's not the way to go.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Careful with that.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You might cut yourself.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Never swung a sword before, have you?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
You look like a baby with a rattle.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Enough of that!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Stop!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Why, traitor?",10,2,Valar Morghulis
So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Let 'em fight.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
That's it? That's what you can do?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You little sh1t.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Your traitor father teach you that?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Or was it your whore mother?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
We are the Watchers on the Wall.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Burn the body.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Aye.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You don't want this one coming back for you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Come along, Jon Snow.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Time to meet the King-Beyond-The-Wall.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
What the ... ?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Khaleesi, please.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Come.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Nothing.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
I am King of Qarth.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I can help you now, truly help you.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
We can take the Iron Throne.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"I'll bring you 1,000 ships.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.",10,2,Valar Morghulis

Khaleesi.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Please! Please!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
- Khaleesi!,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It's all a lie.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Looks real enough to me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Real enough to buy a ship?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Aye, a small ship.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Is this goat?,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It's moose.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn sh1t to keep warm.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"Well, you see a tree, let me know.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is ... ",10,2,Valar Morghulis
Just bloody kill me.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
"No, truly.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
"The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.",10,2,Valar Morghulis
The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
It's Jon and the Halfhand.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
They're back.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
Two blasts is wildlings.,10,2,Valar Morghulis
You're not fighting them alone. Come on.,10,2,Valar Morghulis

Did you send the ravens?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
That was your job.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Your only job.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We need to get back to the Wall.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It's a long march.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Oh!,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

And I'll be free to kill you.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Got no respect, this lot.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
What happened to their fathers?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Some of them were killed by crows like you.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And if he don't...,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I smell a crow.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We killed his friends.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Thought you'd want to question this one.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
What do we want with a baby crow?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He wants to be one of us.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
That half-handed c**t killed friends of mine.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Friends twice your size.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
if you put a sword through their hearts.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And there's plenty of little skeletons,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
buried in the woods.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"What's your name, boy?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Jon Snow.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Your Grace.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Did you hear that?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris

We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"So, you're Ned Stark's b*st*rd.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You can leave us.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The girl likes you.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You like her back, Snow?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
That why you want to join us?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Bearded warrior: Don't panic, boy.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris

He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He was my brother once.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Back when he had a whole hand.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
What were you doing with him?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He wants me to lead one day.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I want to be free.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"No, I don't think so.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I saw...,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You saw what?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I saw what took it.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're telling me you saw one of them?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And why would that make you desert your brothers?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Did I come to the right place?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We'll need to find you a new cloak.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

What are they doing here?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"No, I don't think so.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They stay outside.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I'm not afraid of you, little brother.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why are you here?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I wanted to see your face.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I should hope so.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Thanks to Father.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Thanks to Father.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
No? Curious.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But then I don't suppose you need much room.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're meeting Father today?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
How do you know that?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Father told me. What do you want from him?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
What do I want from him? He's my father.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Do I need to want something?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're going to make me cry.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why do you care what I want from him?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Because you've slandered me to Father before.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Slandered? When?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You did have your guards beat her.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"A girl of nine, I believe.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I was nine, too.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It's not slander if it's true.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Because you're a liar.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Any lies in particular?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Still makes me more clever than you.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( door opens ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Oh, look at these two shining warriors.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Ser Taryn Mant and...,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Ser Whosit of Whocares.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Ser Meryn Trant.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're no knight.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Pod.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
That's exactly who I am.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And you're a grub in fancy armor,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
A number of people in this city want to kill me.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're here to protect me.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I've been doing that for a while now.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Do you grow bored protecting me?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I grow poor protecting you.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Poor? Poor?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Briefly.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm sure you filled your pockets.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And now my pockets are empty.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You've given me a taste for the finer things.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I thought we were friends.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We are.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
How much?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Double.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Double?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm a knight now.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Knights are worth double.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Which means you can afford it.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( breathing heavily ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( waves lapping ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( seabirds calling ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Here. Here!,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Help me!,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( horn blowing ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Who are you?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I was in the battle at Blackwater.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I was a captain and a knight.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Aye, ser, and serving which king?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The one true king of Westeros ... ,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Stannis Baratheon.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I thought you were dead.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Everyone thought you were dead.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And your son?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He may have swam ashore as you did.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I'm so sorry, my friend.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I, too, have lost a son.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
There is nothing worse in this world.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"But, Davos, you were a good father.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If I was a good father, he'd still be here.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Stannis lives?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Will you take me there?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
This war is not over.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Not for you, maybe.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We're both sworn to King Stannis.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I am sworn to no man.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I delivered the ships.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Stannis never gives up. Never.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Now he will regroup ... ,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He's a broken man.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
What?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They say she sang to them as they burned.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm a pirate.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're a smuggler.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Servants of darkness.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Take me back there, please.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You cannot turn Stannis against her.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You could try.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If you fail, they will burn you.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"If you succeed, they'll burn you.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And you've only just come back to life.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Stay alive a little longer, my friend.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I have to stop her.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Please, do this for me.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We should set the siege lines,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"1,000 yards from Harrenhal.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I don't think we're going to get one.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Am I enjoying it?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I was very happy as Hand of the King.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( chuckles ) Yes.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I heard how happy you were.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( blows ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You brought a whore into my bed.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It wasn't your bed at the time.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I sent you here to advise the king.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I gave you real power and authority.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"What do you want, Tyrion?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why does everyone assume I want something?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I bled in the mud for our family.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But what do I want?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Jugglers and singers require applause.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You are a Lannister.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Hmm?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
So tell me what you want.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I want what is mine by right.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I am your son and lawful heir.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You want Casterly Rock?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It is mine by right.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( sighs ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You ask that?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You, who killed your mother to come into the world?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Men's laws give you,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And to teach me humility,",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Sansa: Dorne.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It's going to Dorne.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Shae: Why Dorne?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But it's not coming back.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He's going to stay in Dorne.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Don't ruin the game.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I told you, I don't want to play.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
What about that one there?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
That one?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It's going to Volantis.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
That's not how the game works.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Lovely day for it.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

And your sister.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

You said you'd take me home.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You said King's Landing was your home.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You are the property of the crown.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Stealing you would be treason.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
If you were to tell just one person ... ,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I won't tell anyone.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
How do I know?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Because I'm a terrible liar.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You said so yourself.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You're her handmaiden?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Yes. And you're his...?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I help manage his affairs.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He's an important person.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
So is she.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

"We've both done rather well, you and I.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Yes.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

And where is that?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

And with a true khalasar ... ,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

I heard you were dead.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

We are alone.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I do not judge people for the gods they worship.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

I'm not your enemy.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You are my enemy.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Did I set your ships ablaze?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I could have saved those men.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Do you hear them screaming?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

He never came back.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

"Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He wasn't a knight.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
He was just a soldier.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
And what do knights swear to do?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Protect the weak and uphold the good.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Your father did that. Be proud of him.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Yes.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I've never seen anything like it.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

"if you're not careful, my dear.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The king barely escaped with his life.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Our lives were never truly in danger.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You're right, of course.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
But you are your father's son.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
We can't all have a king's bravery.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Hunger turns men into beasts.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I'm sure she does.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They will stand until they drop.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Such is their obedience.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They may suit my needs.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Tell me of their training.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They begin their training at five.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Missandei: Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They fear nothing.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Even the bravest men fear death.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( continues in Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Missandei: My master says the Unsullied are not men.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Death means nothing to them.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Tell the good master there is no need.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Missandei: My master points out that men don't need nipples.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( continues in Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
How many do you have to sell?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( Missandei speaking Valyrian ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"8,000.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Many other buyers are interested.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"8,000 dead babies.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
The Unsullied are a means to an end.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Once I own them, these men ... ",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
They're not men. Not anymore.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You'll be fair to them.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You won't mutilate them to make a point.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You won't order them to murder babies.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
A great injustice has been done to them.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
Closing your eyes will not undo it.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
( grunts ),1,3,Valar Dohaeris

"I owe you my life, ser.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"The honor is mine, my queen.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
You know this man?,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
King Robert is dead.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.",1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I was sworn to protect your family.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
I failed them.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris

Allow me to join,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.,1,3,Valar Dohaeris
"Mance: Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I saw what took it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"When I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
How did you kill those guards?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Show me how.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"If you would learn, you must come with me.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I want to, but I need to find my brother and mother.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And my sister.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"You have to go. Go to the Wall, to Jon.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Osha, you must protect them.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You're the only one who can.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Karstark: 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"The debt will be repaid, my friend.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
For them and for your sons.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

Those were Stark men.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

Cersei: Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom this morning.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Margaery: I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The king barely escaped with his life.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You said you'd take me home.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
If you were to tell just one...,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Tell me when.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

"No, it was the three-eyed raven.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He's back.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
There was a boy.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I don't want to hear about it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
But you asked.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We've got plenty of worries.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

And who told you that?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The three-eyed raven tell you?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Some good he is, then.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I don't know what other people know and what they don't.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Did you ever think you'd marry one?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Something else?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"By the time Bolton's b*st*rd got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They may have escaped.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

I want to do this.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Yes.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( sheep bleating ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
So how shall we pass the time?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
By putting one foot in front of the other.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It's going to be a very dull walk.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Dull is fine.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Trust me on this.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
People have been serving me since I was born.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She's an honest woman.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
All the good it's done her.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( moans ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
How did you come into Lady Stark's service?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
There's something we can talk about.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Not your concern, Kingslayer.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It had to be recently.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You weren't with her at Winterfell.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
How would you know?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Because I visited Winterfell.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Move.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Were you pledged to Stannis?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Gods, no.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Ah, Renly.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Really?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Shut your mouth.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Could hardly escape the little tulip.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I knew him far better than you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I knew him as well as anyone.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He would have been a wonderful king.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Sounds like you quite fancied him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I did not fancy him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Oh, gods, you did.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Did you ever tell him?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"No, of course not.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You're far too much man for him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'm not interested in foul rumors.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Unless they're about me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It's all true about Renly.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They'd have never got him off it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Shut your mouth!,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I don't blame him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"And I don't blame you, either.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We don't get to choose who we love.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( horse snorts ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Where are you headed, then?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Jaime: South.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Riverrun.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Staying off the kingsroad, are you?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They get you no matter where you go.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You can't win.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"No, you really can't.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Looks like you're safe enough, though.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Meaning no offense, my lady, but...",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( laughs ) I wouldn't tangle with you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( laughs ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Seven blessings to you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Jaime: He knows who I am.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He doesn't.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Maybe you're right.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We're not doing it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He's an innocent man.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Make it tighter here.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That's better.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It makes you look very strong.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No flowers.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I said no flowers.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
All these are wrong. Bring others.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Yes, Your Grace.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Bloody flowers.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
On the king.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Looks like a Tyrell rose.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Should be more than enough fabric.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Tell me what you think of her.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Who?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Margaery.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She's an ideal match.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"It is a good match, but what do you think of her?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She's beautiful and intelligent.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Yes, she is.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Not to me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( chuckles ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That's what intelligent women do ... what they're told.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You need to ask yourself ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I don't need to do anything.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( sighs ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Better.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Much better.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I still don't believe it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He didn't. He didn't want anything.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Littlefinger's not in love with me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Love is not the thing he wants.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He's too old.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They never see it that way.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He didn't ask you to do something for him?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Spy on someone or...?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why? What will you do?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I will make him stop.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( knocks ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Guard: Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Send him in.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Lady Sansa.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Ser Loras.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
May I escort you to them?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"You are too kind, Ser Loras.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You probably don't remember the first time we met.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"A rose, a red rose.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Of course I did.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Margaery: It's more your color.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You take it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Thank you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You're such a dear.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'll take my leave.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Lady Sansa.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Thank you, Ser Loras.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Come.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother... the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Kiss me, child.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We're very sorry for your losses.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He was very gallant.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Gallant, yes.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And charming and very clean.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Father liked him and so did Loras.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That does not make him wise.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
As to your fathead father ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
She might think we have some wits about us.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"One of us, at any rate.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It was treason. I warned them.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
So here we are to see things through.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"What do you say to that, Sansa?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Shall we have some lemon cakes?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Lemon cake's my favorite.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
So we've been told.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Here, Sansa, come sit with me.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'm much less boring than these others.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Do you know my son?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The Lord of Highgarden?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I haven't had the pleasure.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"No great pleasure, believe me.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
A ponderous oaf.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
His father was an oaf as well.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"My husband, the late Lord Luthor.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Now...,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I... I...,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"You, you.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Who else would know better?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We've heard some troubling tales.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Is there any truth to them?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Has this boy mistreated you?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Has he ripped out your tongue?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Joff ... King Joffrey, he ... His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Yes, all Lannisters are lions.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
But how kind is he?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
How clever?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'm to be his wife.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I only want to know what that means.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( footsteps approaching ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Bring me some cheese.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The cheese will be served when I want it served.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And I want it served now.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Are you frightened, child?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No need for that.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We're only women here.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My father always told the truth.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Yes, he had that reputation.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And they named him traitor and took his head.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Joffrey.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Joffrey did that.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And he said that was mercy.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Go on.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I ... I can't. I never meant ... my father was a traitor.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Please don't make me say anymore.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"She's terrified, Grandmother.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Just look at her.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Speak freely, child.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He's a monster.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Ah.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That's a pity.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Please, don't stop the wedding.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
is determined that Margaery shall be queen.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Even so, we thank you for the truth.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Ah, here comes my cheese.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( panting ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Karstark: We're at war.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
This march is a distraction.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Then it's a distraction.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We need his men.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Have you lost faith in our cause?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
If you no longer believe ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I can believe till it snows in Dorne.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You don't think we can win?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I think you lost this war the day you married her.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( horse whinnies ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Whoa, whoa.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Your Grace.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You're afraid of her.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And she knows it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'm not afraid of her.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( snorting ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"May I help you, Lady Stark?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have ... ",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Only a mother can make them.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You've made them before?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Twice.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Did they work?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
After a fashion.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
But it would be a very long night.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
So I sat with him all through the darkness.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Which boy?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Jon Snow.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"So I prayed to the gods, take him away.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Make him die.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He got the pox.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
A murderer.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
A woman he didn't even know.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Let him live and I'll love him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'll be a mother to him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And he lived.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And he lived.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And I couldn't keep my promise.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
And everything that's happened since then...,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
all this horror that's come to my family... it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Yes.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You liked him?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I've got wildling blood in my veins.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
These are my people.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I understand.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Well, how could you understand?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You want to protect your people.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They speak seven different languages in my army.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Everyone hates the cave people.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Because that's the truth.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

Dead. All you had to do was give him the names.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

You could have picked Tywin Lannister.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

That Sansa shouldn't trust him.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

You failed to do this.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

I do beg your pardon.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

What makes you say this?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he ... he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He never wanted to try.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something ... something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Maybe the fault was with me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"No, he was a known... degenerate.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Mmm.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

I took it to ... I took it ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Who gave the orders?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
No one.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I took it on my own.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
To take the North while it was vulnerable.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
What were you going to do once you took it?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Hold it. Rule it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Good. That's very good.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( screams ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why did you do that? I told you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why did you take Winterfell?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Wait. Wait, wait, wait.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I took it because I hated the Starks.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I hated them for holding me prisoner.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words

You've seen it?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Does it have anything to do with warging?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"No, the raven is something different, something deeper.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The raven brings the sight.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
What's he telling him?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Why don't you ask?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Where's the shame in that?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Some people will always need help.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"When my father died, I dreamt it.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You didn't dream it. You saw it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
So did I.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"You have the sight, too?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"When I told my father about your father... for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Your father is Howland Reed?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Yeah.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He saved my father's life during the rebellion.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Your father told you about the rebellion?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Mine never did.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"But I saw that, too.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
What else have you seen?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Only one thing that matters ... you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men laughing ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Thoros: I never liked the skinny ones.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Like drinking from a puddle.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I don't drink ale.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Yeah!,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You see?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It's very tedious for all concerned.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Now, how did three children ... ",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We're not children.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Gendry's a smith.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He was apprenticed in the armory.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
That's because he's twice as good.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Aha! A smith and a salesman.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Gendry stole us weapons.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men laugh ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
My brothers taught me.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men laugh ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Men: Ooh!,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men cheer ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
To your brothers!,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( cheering ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You can finish your meals before you go.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It may be awhile before you see another.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You'll free us?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I gave you my word.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your ... ",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Hey, hey.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men cheering ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Now that is an uncommonly large person.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
One waits for him to drink until he passes out.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Poor man. You have my sympathy.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Aha, not a man at all.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
A Hound!,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men howl and bark ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"So good to see you again, Clegane.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Thoros?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The f*ck you doing here?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Drinking and talking too much.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Same as ever.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( men laugh ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"A pretty prize, lads.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Men: Yeah!,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Girl.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Jaime: It's a tough decision ... take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Silence, Kingslayer.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Good luck.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Which will she choose?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Gambler at heart.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Wouldn't have guessed.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Be quick about it.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( Jaime groans ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I need to rest.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Get up.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
What do you call them?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Get up now.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Corns. I never used to get corns.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same sh1t boots for over a year.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
This heel is ruined. There's no way ... ,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( grunts ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( chuckles ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( sighs ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Ooh.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You move well... for a great beast of a woman.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
It gives away the game.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Bit of a quandary for you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"But if you don't kill me,",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'm going to kill you.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You're good.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Graceless, but good.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( grunting ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( grunts ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( panting ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"( groans, coughs )",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( Jaime breathing heavily ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
( horse neighs ),2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
We enjoy a good fight.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Gets our juices flowing.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
A bit gruesome for my taste.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
You sure he's the one?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"That's him, all right.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Give the man his silver.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
Enough to buy me a new head?,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
"If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off.",2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
I'd rather he takes yours.,2,3,Dark Wings Dark Words
This march is a distraction.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Then it's a distraction.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They're growing fast.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Not fast enough.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I need an army.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
- Who are you?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Thoros of Myr.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Who do you fight for?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The Brotherhood without Banners.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We're trying to save it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Your sister sent me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Yara?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I will not fail you again.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
 What's wrong with him?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He's a warg.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
He's scouting for us.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Orell, where were you this time?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
The Fist of the First Men.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What did you see?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Dead crows.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Get up, Tarly. I forbid you to die.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're responsible for him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Make sure he gets back alive.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"So good to see you again, Clegane.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Girl.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Get up.,3,3,Walk of Punishment

Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Enough to buy me a new head?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing ... ",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Robb knows I meant him no disr ... ,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're lucky I'm not your king.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, there's glory enough to go around.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's not about glory.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I seized an opportunity.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What value was the mill?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Is he there now?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Of course not. We took the fight to him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He could not withstand us.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I could have that head on a spike by now.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Instead, I have a mill.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
We took hostages.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Martyn is 15, I believe.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Have I sued for peace?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
How many men did you lose?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
208.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"But for every man we lost, the Lannisters ... ",3,3,Walk of Punishment
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm sorry.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I didn't know.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You would have.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We seem to be running short of patience here.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You know who isn't?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Tywin Lannister.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Intimate. Lovely table.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Better chairs than the old small council chamber.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What news of Jaime?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"20,000 unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"We are trying, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Try harder.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"What do we have, then?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, let him have it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
She has always been... positively predisposed toward me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Titles do seem to breed titles.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence",3,3,Walk of Punishment
would present certain problems.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Fully agreed.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Master of Coin?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Hear, hear.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
♪ He lifted her high in the air ♪,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"♪ He sniffed and roared and smelled her there ♪
♪ She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair ♪
♪ But he licked the honey from her hair ♪
♪ From there to here, from here to there ♪
♪ All black and brown and covered with hair ♪
♪ He smelled that girl in the summer air ♪
♪ The bear, the bear and the maiden fair... ♪",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I hope you're pleased.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You were armed when we were taken.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I was in chains if you recall.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"All my life I've been hearing, ""Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.""",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You were slower than I expected.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And more predictable.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You were not beating me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Maybe you were as good as people said... once.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
More than once.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You'd be wise not to resist.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Would I?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They'll knock your teeth out.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You think I care about my teeth?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, I don't think you care about your teeth.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If you fight them, they will kill you.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you understand?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I'm the prisoner of value, not you.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Let them have what they want. What does it matter?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What does it matter?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Close your eyes.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Pretend they're Renly.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You'd let them do what they wanted?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"But I'm not, thank the gods.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Doesn't have to look pretty.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Why are you helping him?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You're not our prisoner, little lady.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
What am I?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Our guest.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No one's put any chains on you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"So I can walk away, then?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're lucky we found you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Better than anyone you've ever met.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
A coward's weapon.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I like to fight up close.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Why? So you can kiss him?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You remember the last time you were here?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Looks like every other sh1t inn on the road.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Watch your head.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Off we go.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Walk up!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What are you doing? We're about to leave.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm staying.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're what?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
My brother ain't no king.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Winterfell.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You sure?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm sure.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, I made you something.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
What is it?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's a wolf.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, it is.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
That's the tail?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Yeah.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, be safe.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yeah, you, too.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Don't get stabbed.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You don't... burn your fingers.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Good-bye, Hot Pie.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Good-bye, Arry.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Up you go, little lady.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Hey, Hot Pie.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's really good.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I've missed you, Uncle.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Father missed you, too, from the day you left.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Maybe he never said it in so many words ... ,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Maybe?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Your father was a stubborn old ox.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I was surprised when he died.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Didn't think death had the patience.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm glad you were with him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I wish to the gods I had been.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Did you make peace in the end?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"""Wait for me, little Cat,"" he'd say.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"""Wait for me and I'll come back to you.""",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I will never see them again.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You mustn't think it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We don't know the truth.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They could be in hiding.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Robb believes they're alive.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And he must go on believing.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And you must remain strong for him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're Robb Stark's wife.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Hold still.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Is it true what they say about him?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I don't know. What do they say about him?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
That he can turn into a wolf at night.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
True.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
True.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You're a Lannister, aren't you?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Martyn Lannister.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Martyn Lannister.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You've nothing to fear.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
My husband doesn't eat children.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Unless it's a full moon.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"It's not a full moon tonight, is it?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
See?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Nothing to fear.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Always the artists.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's only horses.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No men.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You said there was dead crows.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
There was.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
How many men were here?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
About 300.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And you know what those men are now?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We're all the same to them ... meat for their army.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you think anyone got away?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's not impossible.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You don't go far betting against Mormont.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
And he lost.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
His best fighting men are dead.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Tormund.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Climb the Wall.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Take Orell and 20 good men.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And take this one.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"And if he's useful, good. If not... throw him off the Wall.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
See if crows can fly.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"We're finally going to war, old friend?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Hide near Castle Black.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When I give the signal, hit them in the night.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
We'll meet again.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Aye.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
If you do your job.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Ah.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
How will we see your signal?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Send your eagle above the Wall every night.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Ghost?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What have we here? Frozen crows?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We've come a long way.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Smaller flock than you went north with.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We can talk inside.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Oh, can we?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
They need some water.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Tether it and I'll be inside.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Keep your eyes where they belong.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They're not for you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Aye, pig's got value to me.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You are a godly man?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I am. I got no fear of what's out there.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks",3,3,Walk of Punishment
and bloody fires won't help you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The real gods.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Women.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Barely a grunt.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And she's almost as fat as this one here.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Now why don't you dine on him?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Carve off what you need as you go.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Here we are.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Sharpen these for me, would ya?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I see the head. Push.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
That's it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're nearly there.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
One more push should do it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What is it? What is it?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Keep quiet.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I can ride.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're sure?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Ride east. Follow the rising sun.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Your sister's waiting for you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We're not in the Iron Islands.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Go.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on. Come on.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on. Come on.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on back.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You refuse to tell me where you're going?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I don't know yet. The fires will show me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
How long will you be gone?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I don't know.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're abandoning me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I will never abandon you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You are the Son of Fire.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I am sworn to serve you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Then serve me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When I return, you will understand.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
My enemies think they've destroyed me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I want Joffrey dead.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I want Robb Stark dead.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Make me another son.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I cannot.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Why?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You don't have the strength. It would kill you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I want you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Your fires burn low, my king.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
There is another way. A better way.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You told me your magic requires a king's blood.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Yes.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm the one true king.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You are.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
But there are others with your blood in their veins.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
The Lord of Light demands it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
To whom?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Give me your water.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Here, drink.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Leave this place, Your Grace.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Leave tonight, I beg you.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
And what is she to do for soldiers?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Is it ""we"" already, Ser Barristan?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Three.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You know what I saw? Butchery.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Babies, children, old men.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
More women raped than you can count.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
But the Unsullied are not men.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They do not rape.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I bled beside him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I wish I had known him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
But he was not the last dragon.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
All?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
They did not. I want to buy them all.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Is this what you mean by all?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes. 8,000.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
And the ones still in training as well.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I will have them all or take none.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Many will fall in battle.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Because Master Kraznys is generous.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The gold you have left is worth 10.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The Dothraki you have with you ... ,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"7,877 Unsullied.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I have dragons. I'll give you one.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Khaleesi, please.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Three dragons.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
One.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Two.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
One.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They want the biggest one.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Done.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Done.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I'll take you as well, now.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
A token of a bargain well struck.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Aegon Targaryen proved that.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're both here to advise me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Is that understood?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you have a name?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, Your Grace. No family living.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Do you know what he said to me?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"""Let me die.""",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
All questions have been taken from them.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"They obey, that is all.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Once they are yours, they are yours.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
They will fall on their swords if you command it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You may go hungry.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You may fall sick.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You may be killed.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Valar morghulis.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, all men must die.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
But we are not men.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm surprised you're surprised.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
This is the safest place in the city.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Not for bastards.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"That's all of them, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Thank you, my dear.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Pod.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Pod. Take them outside.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'll be there in a moment.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Only my life.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Not all that significant, I'm afraid.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You should have him knighted.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
If only the Master of Coin had such power.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
If only.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I owe you a significant debt.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Our redheaded friend.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You secured her release when the queen detained her.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Oh, that.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
We don't. I did f*ck her once.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I know.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
But we don't.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I know.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
But how would the queen get that idea?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Why don't you ask her?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Any advice for me on my new position?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Keep a low profile.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, you are richer than I am.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Good point.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Trivial even.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You want a real challenge?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Try whores.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I've tried quite a few.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, lots of work to do.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Enjoy the Eyrie.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Come on, I'm here later.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Tonight, then.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Looks like dull reading.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You think all reading is dull reading.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Unless he made it all up, yes.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Podrick, do keep up.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Podrick.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, my lord?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Wonderful.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Genna specializes in first-timers.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"She's not bad with second-timers, either.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Uh, my lord...",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Now, as it happens, Marei... is quite the spear handler herself.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He's handsome.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You didn't tell me he was handsome.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"My lord, I don't even...",3,3,Walk of Punishment
She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as ""my lord.""",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Be back in time for my supper.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Pace yourself, lad.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Let me guess. He's not a magician.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He's stealing it?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Worse, he's borrowing it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
What's wrong with that?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
The crown owes millions to my father.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Forgive a debt, my father?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I've never borrowed money before.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm not clear on the rules.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Well...,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Ahem!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
And what if I don't?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, you have to.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
But what if I don't?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
This is why I don't lend you money.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We owe them tens of millions.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"One way or another, they always get their gold back.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Ah, the return of the conquering hero.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The lad's practically skipping.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You were gone a long time.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I trust you got your money's worth.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Or should I say my money's worth?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
This is more than I give you in a year.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
He's a squire. You don't pay him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"They wouldn't take it, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor,3,3,Walk of Punishment
with the new Master of Coin.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What did you tell them?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I didn't tell them anything.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
What did you do to them?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Lots of things.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And they seemed to like these things?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Of course they seemed to like it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They're paid to seem to like it.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Only they weren't paid.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Is that what you're telling us?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Sit down, Podrick.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
We're going to need details.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Copious details.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on! Come on!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Ha! Ha!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Take off his pants.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
No! No!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, no, no!",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm gonna f*ck you into the dirt.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, please! No, no, no!",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, don't!",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"No, please!",3,3,Walk of Punishment
No! No!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You little b*st*rd.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Come, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're a long way from home and winter is coming.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'll take the big bitch first.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous c**t.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Nobody said sh1t about you.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're only making it worse.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Take her over there where it's dark.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'd like a little privacy.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Come on!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You know who she is, don't you?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Never been with a woman that big.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
She's Brienne of Tarth.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Heard of Tarth?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm gonna cut your throat!,3,3,Walk of Punishment
They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Sapphires are gemstones.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
The blue ones.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I know what they are.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Bring her back here.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Yes, my lord.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Get up.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
 Come on.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Come on, on your feet.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Unbesmirched.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Not defiled.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Fancy word for a fancy man.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I learned a lot of fancy words.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
I bet you did.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Lands, titles ... you'll have them all.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
The North can't win this war.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You're a smart man. You understand that.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
We have the numbers. We have the gold.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Aye, you have both.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Hard to argue with that.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
None of us are.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Come on, men.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"I'm famished, actually.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Well, I do like partridge.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Will this work as a table, my lord?",3,3,Walk of Punishment
"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic ... ah!",3,3,Walk of Punishment
On the stump.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
You think you're the smartest man there is.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
My father ... ,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say ""my father"" and that's it, all your troubles are gone.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Don't.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Have you got something to say?,3,3,Walk of Punishment
Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing.,3,3,Walk of Punishment
"You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here.",3,3,Walk of Punishment
Never forget that.,3,3,Walk of Punishment

You're nothing without your daddy.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Never forget that.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Here, this should help you remember.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Depends if he's had any practice.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer?",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
She loosened you up for us?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Water.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Water.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Stop!,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Far enough.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Do that again and I'll take your other hand.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Come on, you.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I hope we might speak.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
In confidence.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Oh, always in confidence.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
About the events of the Blackwater.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Perhaps this is the wrong time?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to ... ,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
End your life?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Which is why I'm coming to you.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I need proof.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Proof?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Will there be a trial?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I need to know.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I have no proof, only whispers.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Do you want to hear it still?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I don't know. Do I?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But what he wanted was far worse.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He burned my parts in a brazier.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I still dream of that night.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I dream of the voice from the flames.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Was it a god? A demon?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
A conjuror's trick?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I don't know.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
A symbolic revenge of sorts.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Which will require a degree of influence, which ... ",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You do not possess at the moment.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I resolved to live to spite him.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I begged.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Influence grows like a weed.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
The sorcerer.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Hello, my old friend.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
It's been a long time.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time... if you have the stomach for it.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Or the sh1t.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
And getting attacked or killed or worse.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"And that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Oh, look.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
More sh1t.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
We need to get out of here.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

I don't have time for you.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Extraordinary.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
The most extraordinary man they've ever had.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

We're talking about the same Podrick?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Seems a bit simple?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
What did he do to them?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I don't know, my lord.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
The girls are usually quite descriptive.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
So what did they say?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
They said it was hard to describe.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Huh.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He was too preoccupied to notice.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But I don't think he's lost interest.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
What makes you say so?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
His shipboard inventory.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Ah.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You can read.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Rare for a woman in your profession.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Former profession.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Of course.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Two featherbeds.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Could he be bringing one of his girls?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"He's not interested in them, my lord.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
How do you know?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Because I'm one of his girls.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Prodigies in odd places indeed.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
It ate her while her son watched.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

"Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Aerion Brightflame they called him.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

He was wrong.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

"No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Such a tragedy.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
A fairly predictable tragedy.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Hunting and drinking don't mix.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I should say not.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He had no business fighting an actual warrior.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

The gods have seen fit to make it so.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
My father didn't want them here.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

"I'm sorry, Your Grace.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Shall we go and see them?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Why would you risk your life for me?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I was only a boy when they took you away.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Did he?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I ... I don't know, my lord.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
They ... they never told me much.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
My sister's men are loyal to her.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
We don't need to hide from them.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Not all those are your sister's men.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Some of them are loyal to your father.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
What is it?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
What did he tell you to do?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Raid fishing villages.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He didn't trust me.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Thought I was a Stark.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Ha. I could never be a Stark.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He lorded it over you?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Didn't have to.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
All he had to do was be.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Be who he was born to be.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
His life fit him better than his clothes.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
How could someone like that ever be a brother to me?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He's the King in the North.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
And me... my father gave me a choice and I made it.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I could never be a Stark.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

I murdered those boys.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
The Stark boys?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Never found them.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies... so I could keep Winterfell... and make my father proud.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Maybe it's not too late.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
It is.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

You sound like a bloody woman.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I know what you did for me.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Are you here to seduce me?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
A question for the philosophers.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But you've come mincing all this way for something.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
So?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Might I sit?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
No.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I'm curious why you've sought me out.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Have I?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Why shouldn't I take an interest?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
She's an interesting girl.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Is she?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"No, not particularly.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But she's had an interesting childhood.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"She has, sadly.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Come, come.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You surrender rather easily.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Walk with me.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Which is Sansa Stark?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Neither. A babe in the woods.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I admired her father.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Yes.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I could not help Lord Stark.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

How?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
That's hardly surprising.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
And why have you come to me with this matter?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

How long before he has the army?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Which seems such a shame.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You must despise him.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You're working so hard to undermine him.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Actually, I rather enjoy him.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"You are a clever man, Lord Varys.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You are too kind.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I believe I have a possible solution.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
One doesn't need to be clever for that.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"It's all rather obvious, isn't it?",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Ahem.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I didn't mean to disturb you.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You haven't.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"We'd like some privacy, please.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

What did you pray for?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

"Pig-face, she called me.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Pig-face? That's ridiculous.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I think it had something to do with my nose.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Porridge plague?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You don't have it in the North?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
But that's awful.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You're ... ,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I believed you!,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Don't say that. No, you're not.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
So what happened to Alanna?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
It's all terribly frustrating.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"I want us to be friends, good friends.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
That would make me very happy.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You must see Highgarden.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You'd love it there. I know you would.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

Would you like that?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
His name was Bannen.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
"He was a good man, a good ranger.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He came to us from ... where did he come from?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Down White Harbor way.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
He came to us from White Harbor.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Never failed in his duty.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

We shall never see his like again.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
And now his watch has ended.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
And now his watch has ended.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
It wasn't his foot that killed him.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
That b*st*rd Craster starved him to death.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Craster's got his daughters to feed.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
You on his side?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
We can't just show up and steal all his food.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

"The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.",4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

I'm glad for you.,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended
Are you now?,4,3,And Now His Watch is Ended

"But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"1,000 men.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
We'll find out soon enough.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't need you to protect me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Of course you do.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Who vouched for you with Mance?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It seems you owe me a debt.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Give it back.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Well, I stole it.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ygritte!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ygritte!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ygritte! Seven hells.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ygritte!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is Orell right?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Are you still a crow?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's time you proved yourself.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ygritte.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You swore some vows.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I want you to break 'em.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I want you to see me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
All of me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We shouldn't.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We should.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Why are you still dressed?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"You know nothing, Jon Sno ... ",5,3,Kissed by Fire
That thing you did with your mouth ... is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't know.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Hmm.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You seemed to like it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Aye, I liked it some.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Who taught you that?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There's been no one else. Only you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
A maid.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You were a maid.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I was a man of the Night's Watch.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
How about you? Were you a maid?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What do you think?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Who was he?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Just a boy.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He came trading with his brothers.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But... he was weak.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Not like you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That was the first one.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Then there was this Thenn boy.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
We'd best get back.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Tormund ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm not done with you yet.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
How long's it been since you had a bath?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Let's not go back.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Let's stay here a while longer.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Not ever.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I want my gold.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We're outlaws. Outlaws steal.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're lucky we didn't kill you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Come try it, archer.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Not in the eyes of god.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You can't!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Riders coming through!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Kingslayer.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Down!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
On your knees.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Pick him up, Locke.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You've lost a hand.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"No, my lord, he has it here.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Take this away.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Send it to his father?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Cut her free. Apologies, my lady.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're under my protection now.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Thank you, my lord.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Find suitable rooms for our guests.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We'll speak later.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Lord Bolton.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is there word from the capital?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You haven't heard?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Sailed into Blackwater Bay.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And your sister...,5,3,Kissed by Fire
How can I put this?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your sister... is alive and well.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your father's forces prevailed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ser Jaime isn't well.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Take him to Qyburn.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Will I die?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
No.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The corruption has spread.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I fear it must be cut away.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Then you'll die.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're no maester.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Where's your chain?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Citadel stripped me of it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They found some of my experiments too bold.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't need my right hand to kill you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Mmm.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"With any luck, that will suffice.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You'll need milk of the poppy.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
No milk of the poppy.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There will be pain.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll scream.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Quite a bit of pain.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll scream loudly.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Lord Baelish.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your Grace.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Of course, Your Grace.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Myself, I often find them a hindrance.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I shall do my best.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Thank you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I assure you that it will.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Pardon, my lady.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
No need to speak.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Are there any figs? Fetch some.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I always take figs midafternoon.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They help move the bowels.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
To what do I owe this summons?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Thank you for seeing me, my lady.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's the royal wedding.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Naturally.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The word extravagant has been used.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I understand that.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Good.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"As of now, it's a huge expense.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
And?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"And we're at war, Lady Olenna.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yes, and maintaining supply lines ... ",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I can't think how it slipped my mind.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"1,800 mounted lances.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"2,000 in support.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Provisions so this city might survive the winter.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
A million bushels of wheat.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"20,000 head of cattle.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"50,000 sheep.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm quite familiar with them.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
As is a royal wedding.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The people are hungry for more than just food.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They crave distractions.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
A royal wedding is much safer.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Wouldn't you say?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I would.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And traditionally paid for by the royal family.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Where did you go for them, Volantis?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
My lady ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Oh, very well.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is that sufficient?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Quite sufficient. Thank you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Give me that.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What are you doing?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Just mending Lord Beric's armor.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Why?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Have you lost your mind?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You don't have to do this.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I want to.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They need good men.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
And then you ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What? Serve him?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've served men my entire life.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm done serving.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You just said you were serving Lord Beric.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He may be their leader, but they chose him.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
These men are brothers. They're a family.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've never had a family.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I can be your family.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You wouldn't be my family.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"You'd be ""my lady.""",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Willem.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Willem!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is this a rescue?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Lannister filth! Take him!,5,3,Kissed by Fire

Please ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Bring them in.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is that all of them?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Not murder, Your Grace.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Vengeance.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Vengeance?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Those boys didn't kill your sons.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Was strangled by the Kingslayer.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They were his kin.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They were boys!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Look at them.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Tell your mother to look at them.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
She killed them as much as I.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
My mother had nothing to do with this.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
This was your treason.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's treason to free your enemies.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"In war, you kill your enemies.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Did your father not teach you that, boy?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Leave him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Aye.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Leave me to the king.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That's how he deals with treason.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Our King in the North.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Hang the rest.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I only watched for the guards.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
This one was only the watcher.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Hang him last so he can watch the others die.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Please! Please, no. They made me do it!",5,3,Kissed by Fire
They made me! They made me!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Word of this can't leave Riverrun.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Lannisters pay their debts.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They never stop talking about it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It wouldn't be lying.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks,",5,3,Kissed by Fire
no matter how highborn.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He has to die.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Karstarks are Northmen.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
They won't forgive the killing of their lord.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your mother's right.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You tended to their wounds.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You brought them supper. Now they're dead.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You need Karstark men to end it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
A hostage.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I fought the Mad King for your father.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I fought Joffrey for you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We are kin ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Stark and Karstark.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That didn't stop you from betraying me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And it won't save you now.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't want it to save me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Kneel, my lord.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Rickard Karstark,",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Would you speak a final word?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Kill me and be cursed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You are no king of mine.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Joffrey.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Cersei.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ilyn Payne.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ser Meryn.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Hound.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What are you going to do with me?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your brother's there now.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Don't think of it that way.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But it is that way.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It is.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And it isn't.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
More is than isn't.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
So why don't you?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We need the gold.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Do I frighten you, child?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
No.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're angry with me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And I don't blame you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But letting him go was the right thing.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I have more reason than most to want him hanged.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I thought he killed you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He did.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But how...?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Thoros... how many times have you brought me back?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's the Lord of Light brings you back.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
How many times?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Five, I think.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"No, this makes six.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Six.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There was the first time ... the Mountain.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Show her.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Lance right through the chest.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Then I was stabbed in the belly.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Then it was an arrow in the back.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And that axe in the side.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And the Hound makes six.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You'd think you'd learn.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"It's not getting any easier, you know.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I know.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Every time I come back, I'm a bit less.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Pieces of you get chipped away.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Could you bring back a man without a head?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Not six times. Just once.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I don't think it works that way, child.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He was a good man, Ned Stark.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He's at rest now, somewhere.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I would never wish my life upon him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I would.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're alive.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Lord, cast your light upon me.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Protect me in the darkness.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Burn away my sins.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Help me serve you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Use me as you will.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
For the night is dark and full of terrors.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
My lady.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I meant to come sooner.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The battle ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I know of your troubles, my king.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yes, of course.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You mustn't despair. Your claim is true.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You will be victorious.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I believed that once.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Selyse.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've broken a sacred vow.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've sinned.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
No.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've wronged you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I have shamed you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're doing god's work.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You don't understand.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Red Woman ... the Lady Melisandre ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I know, Stannis.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"When she told me, I wept with joy.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Oh, my sweet boys.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Petyr, Tommard, Edric.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
She gave you a son.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I gave you... nothing.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That's not true.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
So you've come to see her as well?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There is no need.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You must keep away from such distractions.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
She's my daughter.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I want to see her.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You are a king.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You don't need my permission.,5,3,Kissed by Fire

No.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He did.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He fought bravely.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He hasn't come to visit me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He won't be visiting, child.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Why not? He's my friend.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Look.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He made this for me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But don't tell Mother I have it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's a secret.,5,3,Kissed by Fire

Help me out of these rags.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Now get out.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There's another tub.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
This one suits me fine.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Don't worry. I'm not interested.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"If I faint, pull me out.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Why should I care how you die?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"You swore a solemn vow, remember?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Not going so well, is it?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That was unworthy. Forgive me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You protected me better than most ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Don't you mock me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm apologizing.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm sick of fighting.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Let's call a truce.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You need trust to have a truce.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I trust you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There it is. There's the look.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've seen it for 17 years on face after face.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You all despise me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Kingslayer.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Oathbreaker.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
A man without honor.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You've heard of wildfire?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Of course.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Mad King was obsessed with it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered",5,3,Kissed by Fire
and melted off their bones.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He burned lords he didn't like.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He burned anyone who was against him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Before long, half the country was against him.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city ...  beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Under houses, stables, taverns.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Finally, the day of reckoning came.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I knew my father better than that.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He's never been one to pick the losing side.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I told the Mad King as much.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I urged him to surrender peacefully.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But the king didn't listen to me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken c**t.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""You can trust the Lannisters,"" he said.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.""",5,3,Kissed by Fire
So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
He told me to... bring him my father's head.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Then he... turned to his pyromancer.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""Burn them all,"" he said.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""Burn them in their homes.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Burn them in their beds.""",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Would you have kept your oath then?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"First, I killed the pyromancer.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""Burn them all,"" he kept saying.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""Burn them all.""",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't think he expected to die.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He ... he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That's where Ned Stark found me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
If this is true... why didn't you tell anyone?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Stark?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
By what right does the wolf judge the lion?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
By what right?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Help! Help!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Kingslayer!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Jaime.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
My name is Jaime.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Onion Knight.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Ser Onion Knight.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Shh, you'll wake Bert.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Bert?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
If your father knew ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He said you were a traitor.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Are you?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I am, child.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't care. You're my friend.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You must get bored down here.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I brought you something to read.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's about Aegon and his dragons.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And the Targaryens built this castle.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Aye.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
So they did.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You can hide the book under your cloak.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Take it. I have more.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"My lady, I can't read the words.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You can't?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
No. No. No.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's easy. It'll be fun.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Go. We can't.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Why not?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"What will they do, lock us in cells?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I wouldn't know where to start.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
At the beginning.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
This word is Aegon.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"And the title of the whole book is ""An History of Aegon the Conqueror",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"and His Conquest of Westeros.""",5,3,Kissed by Fire
It was a bitch of a siege.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Robert knighted you after the battle?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Proudest moment of my life.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"""In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.""",5,3,Kissed by Fire
All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
In full plate metal for 16 hours.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Robert would have laughed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"He was a good man, a great warrior.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
And a terrible king.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You swore an oath.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Yes.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Do you believe in her?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
With all my heart.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
These are the ones?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yes, khaleesi. The officers.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Names that remind them what they are ...  vermin.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
King Robert wanted her dead.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Of course he wanted her dead.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I didn't sit on the small council.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
No?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Can't say I minded much.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I always hated the politics.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yeah, I imagine I would, too.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Mm-hmm.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Which men do you have in mind?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
It suffered for a reason.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I sold men into slavery.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Our cause?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You only joined us a few days ago.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I can't speak to your intentions.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're not Lord Commander here.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're just another exile.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And I take my orders from the queen.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
 Come to bed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You were right.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Karstarks are gone.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Almost half our forces.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Nothing.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Only wait.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Don't let him.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What can I do?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Attack King's Landing?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There's nothing he'd like better.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He'd crush us in a day.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We could ride north.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Take your land back from the Greyjoys.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Wait out the winter.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Winter could last five years.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Now we're like a band of bickering children.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Give them a new purpose.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Oh, I don't know.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I don't even know where Winterfell is.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Here.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And we're here. King's Landing ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What is it?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
And Casterly Rock can't run away.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm going to take their home away from them.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Can you do it?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry ... ,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Walder Frey.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He's such a splendid fighter.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Do you have any idea when we might...,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It should grow quickly.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Joffrey won't let me leave.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And only one to let you go.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Because it will please me.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Squire!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Well fought, ser.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
That was no fight. I don't know you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Olyver, if it please you.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
How did you know?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Know what?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That I wanted to.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
My lord...,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"They rarely do, in my experience.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"You have a good deal of experience, do you?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
With the husbands.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That didn't take long.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Well, it took long enough.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is he?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And... who's the lucky girl?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've always wanted a ship.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Now I want a dozen.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Strange, isn't it?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
What is?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your hair is different.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Is it?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Lady Margaery wears it that way.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Many ladies wear it this way.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I have good news.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'll be leaving the city soon.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You still want me to come with you?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's not a question of what I want.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
It's what you want.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"You want to go home, don't you?",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Of course. More than anything.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
But maybe it would be better to wait.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Not just for me, but for you.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You've been so kind.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your true friend.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I do, Lord Baelish.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Petyr.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Petyr.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
We'll speak again when I return.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're late.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What's she doing here?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Our business concerns her, too.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Sit.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Never mind that now.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We have something important to discuss.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Stop that.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're making me uncomfortable.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Very well.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
She's a lovely girl.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Your jokes are not appreciated.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"It wasn't my best, but ... ",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Sansa is the key to the North?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I seem to remember she has an older brother.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Karstarks have marched home.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Plots are not public knowledge.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And how do we do that?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Wonderful.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yes, it is.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You can't mean it.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I can and I do.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
That's cruel even for you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Do you intend on mistreating her?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
She's a child!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Surely you're capable of that.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And if I refuse?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
And it is past time you were wed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I was wed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Or don't you remember?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Only too well.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You should be thanking the gods for this.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
This is more than you deserve.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
Tyrion will do as he's bid.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
As will you.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
What do you mean?,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You'll marry Ser Loras.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
I will not.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
The boy is heir to Highgarden.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"No, I won't do it.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Yes, you will.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
You're my daughter!,5,3,Kissed by Fire
You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.,5,3,Kissed by Fire
"Father, don't make me do it again, please.",5,3,Kissed by Fire
Not another word.,5,3,Kissed by Fire

"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men.",6,3,The Climb
Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.,6,3,The Climb
What does it do?,6,3,The Climb
"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?",6,3,The Climb
( baby coos ),6,3,The Climb
How much longer?,6,3,The Climb
Not so far.,6,3,The Climb
A few more days.,6,3,The Climb
Is the Wall as big as they say?,6,3,The Climb
Bigger.,6,3,The Climb
So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.,6,3,The Climb
You're playing with me.,6,3,The Climb
"I'm not. It's 700 feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping.",6,3,The Climb
Castle Black is nice enough.,6,3,The Climb
They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night.,6,3,The Climb
And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty.,6,3,The Climb
"Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.",6,3,The Climb
Do you sing?,6,3,The Climb
No.,6,3,The Climb
"No, no, no. Not very well.",6,3,The Climb
Sing me a song.,6,3,The Climb
"Oh, all right.",6,3,The Climb
Let's see.,6,3,The Climb

That's not how you skin a rabbit.,6,3,The Climb
I know how to skin a rabbit.,6,3,The Climb
Not by the looks of it.,6,3,The Climb
"You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.",6,3,The Climb
I didn't see any game before I got here.,6,3,The Climb
"If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.",6,3,The Climb
"Well, I made this bow myself.",6,3,The Climb
Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.,6,3,The Climb
"You learn how to use your fists, though.",6,3,The Climb
"Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?",6,3,The Climb
I had someone else in mind.,6,3,The Climb
"Well, someone else is sitting right here.",6,3,The Climb
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.,6,3,The Climb
Some of us are just a little better.,6,3,The Climb
"Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them.",6,3,The Climb
Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?,6,3,The Climb
"You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.",6,3,The Climb
Bran: Stop it!,6,3,The Climb
Hodor.,6,3,The Climb
You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.,6,3,The Climb
"Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.",6,3,The Climb
You've been nasty to her every day.,6,3,The Climb
Of course she's nasty back.,6,3,The Climb
Me? It's my fault?,6,3,The Climb
"First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.",6,3,The Climb
"First time I met you, you held a knife at me.",6,3,The Climb
We can't fight each other.,6,3,The Climb
We'll never make it to the Wall.,6,3,The Climb
I want you both to make peace.,6,3,The Climb
Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.,6,3,The Climb
"I said so, didn't I?",6,3,The Climb
Osha!,6,3,The Climb
You're a good little hunter.,6,3,The Climb
Thank you.,6,3,The Climb
See?,6,3,The Climb
"Not so hard, is it? Thank you.",6,3,The Climb
Don't push me.,6,3,The Climb

I'm right here with you.,6,3,The Climb
What's wrong with him?,6,3,The Climb
The visions take their toll.,6,3,The Climb
He's having one now?,6,3,The Climb
I saw Jon Snow.,6,3,The Climb
You saw him?,6,3,The Climb
At Castle Black?,6,3,The Climb
He was on the wrong side of the Wall... surrounded by enemies.,6,3,The Climb
Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall.,6,3,The Climb
Crows would come out every morning with axes.,6,3,The Climb
Your flock gets smaller every year.,6,3,The Climb
You ever climbed it before?,6,3,The Climb
No.,6,3,The Climb
But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.,6,3,The Climb
You're afraid.,6,3,The Climb
Aren't you?,6,3,The Climb
Aye.,6,3,The Climb
It's a long way up and a long way down.,6,3,The Climb
But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there.,6,3,The Climb
"Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.",6,3,The Climb
"They're too big for you, but they're good.",6,3,The Climb
You kill someone for them?,6,3,The Climb
"Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.",6,3,The Climb
He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.,6,3,The Climb
He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.,6,3,The Climb
Can we not talk about that here?,6,3,The Climb
"( mocking ) ""Can we not talk about that here?",6,3,The Climb
I'm Jon Snow.,6,3,The Climb
"I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.""",6,3,The Climb
Did I seem scared the other day?,6,3,The Climb
You were trembling like a leaf.,6,3,The Climb
Only in the beginning.,6,3,The Climb

Only in the beginning.,6,3,The Climb
"You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.",6,3,The Climb
What secret?,6,3,The Climb
Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up?,6,3,The Climb
You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.,6,3,The Climb
"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.",6,3,The Climb
You're going to be loyal to your woman.,6,3,The Climb
The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.,6,3,The Climb
Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.,6,3,The Climb
We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.,6,3,The Climb
It's you and me that matters to me and you.,6,3,The Climb
Don't ever betray me.,6,3,The Climb
I won't.,6,3,The Climb
'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.,6,3,The Climb
Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step.,6,3,The Climb

Never hold.,6,3,The Climb

Your muscles tense up when you hold.,6,3,The Climb
Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release.,6,3,The Climb
Never hold.,6,3,The Climb
But I have to aim.,6,3,The Climb
Never aim.,6,3,The Climb
Never aim?,6,3,The Climb

Six.,6,3,The Climb
I've always been a terrible priest.,6,3,The Climb
Drank too much rum.,6,3,The Climb
f*cked all the whores in King's Landing.,6,3,The Climb
"It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.",6,3,The Climb
"I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave.",6,3,The Climb
"So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show.",6,3,The Climb
A spectacle for the locals.,6,3,The Climb
"Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but... he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew.",6,3,The Climb
"And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied.",6,3,The Climb
Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth.,6,3,The Climb
Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him.,6,3,The Climb

The other side?,6,3,The Climb

So let's play a game.,6,3,The Climb
Which body part do you need the least?,6,3,The Climb
Please.,6,3,The Climb
Please is not a body part.,6,3,The Climb
"I'll tell you everything, please.",6,3,The Climb
But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't,6,3,The Climb
appreciate you.,6,3,The Climb
"One good bit, though.",6,3,The Climb
"The Stark boys, they're still alive.",6,3,The Climb

"I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am",6,3,The Climb

Did you see any banners flying when we came in?,6,3,The Climb
No. It was just a guess.,6,3,The Climb
"Very good, Lord Theon.",6,3,The Climb
And who am I?,6,3,The Climb
Torrhen Karstark.,6,3,The Climb
He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.,6,3,The Climb
He was your brother.,6,3,The Climb
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.,6,3,The Climb
You swore to tell me if I--,6,3,The Climb
You're right.,6,3,The Climb
Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman.,6,3,The Climb
I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.,6,3,The Climb
Yes.,6,3,The Climb
You win.,6,3,The Climb

Robb: Thank you for riding here so quickly.,6,3,The Climb
I know travel isn't easy in these times.,6,3,The Climb
The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.,6,3,The Climb
"But when the King of the North summons us, we come.",6,3,The Climb
Lothar: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue,6,3,The Climb
if his terms are met.,6,3,The Climb
Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.,6,3,The Climb
Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.,6,3,The Climb
"As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.",6,3,The Climb
I don't think that's--,6,3,The Climb
We are fighting for the North.,6,3,The Climb
Harrenhal is not in the North.,6,3,The Climb
It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.,6,3,The Climb
And there's something else.,6,3,The Climb
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.,6,3,The Climb
"Not what, whom.",6,3,The Climb
What?,6,3,The Climb
( chuckles ) No.,6,3,The Climb
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters-- Roslin.,6,3,The Climb
How old is she?,6,3,The Climb
19.,6,3,The Climb
Could I see her first?,6,3,The Climb
You want to count her teeth?,6,3,The Climb
We depart for the Twins in the morning.,6,3,The Climb
We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.,6,3,The Climb
Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?,6,3,The Climb
Father is old.,6,3,The Climb
It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.,6,3,The Climb
And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.,6,3,The Climb
He has every right to be.,6,3,The Climb
Please excuse us while we discuss it.,6,3,The Climb
Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?,6,3,The Climb
"At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.",6,3,The Climb
I'm his liege lord.,6,3,The Climb
Robb: He's a proud man and we've wounded him.,6,3,The Climb
I didn't wound him.,6,3,The Climb
My answer is no.,6,3,The Climb
Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-- The laws of gods and men are very clear.,6,3,The Climb
No man can compel another man to marry.,6,3,The Climb
The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.,6,3,The Climb
It's all right. You heard him.,6,3,The Climb
"If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.",6,3,The Climb
He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12.,6,3,The Climb
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.,6,3,The Climb
"When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.",6,3,The Climb
You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?,6,3,The Climb
I have a war to fight.,6,3,The Climb
We can't win it without them.,6,3,The Climb
I have no time to haggle.,6,3,The Climb
You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.,6,3,The Climb
You recall that heroic engagement?,6,3,The Climb
I had something less permanent in mind.,6,3,The Climb
"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war.",6,3,The Climb
"If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.",6,3,The Climb
I'll marry her.,6,3,The Climb
"You're paying for my sins, Uncle.",6,3,The Climb
It's not fair or right.,6,3,The Climb
I'll remember it.,6,3,The Climb
Roose: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.,6,3,The Climb
Brienne: Yes. Most kind of them.,6,3,The Climb
"You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.",6,3,The Climb
I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.,6,3,The Climb
"When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.",6,3,The Climb
"If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.",6,3,The Climb
I should send you back to Robb Stark.,6,3,The Climb
You should.,6,3,The Climb
"But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner.",6,3,The Climb
Why might that be?,6,3,The Climb
Wars cost money.,6,3,The Climb
Many people would pay a great deal for you.,6,3,The Climb
We both know who would pay the most.,6,3,The Climb
Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north,6,3,The Climb
for a summary execution.,6,3,The Climb
You're right.,6,3,The Climb
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.,6,3,The Climb
"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.",6,3,The Climb
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.,6,3,The Climb
He doesn't have time for anything else.,6,3,The Climb
He'll make time for you.,6,3,The Climb
"As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing",6,3,The Climb
as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.,6,3,The Climb
"And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.",6,3,The Climb
Shall we drink on it?,6,3,The Climb
I don't partake.,6,3,The Climb
You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?,6,3,The Climb
Very well.,6,3,The Climb
"My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.",6,3,The Climb
"Oh, she won't be going with you.",6,3,The Climb
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to--,6,3,The Climb
You are charged with abetting treason.,6,3,The Climb
I'm afraid I must insist.,6,3,The Climb
You're in no place to insist on anything.,6,3,The Climb
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.,6,3,The Climb
Olenna: Impossible.,6,3,The Climb
Why?,6,3,The Climb
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.,6,3,The Climb
The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.,6,3,The Climb
Your daughter--,6,3,The Climb
"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms... and the mother of the king.",6,3,The Climb
Old.,6,3,The Climb
Old?,6,3,The Climb
Old.,6,3,The Climb
I'm something of an expert on the subject.,6,3,The Climb
Her change will be upon her before long.,6,3,The Climb
I'll spare you the details of what will happen then.,6,3,The Climb
"You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.",6,3,The Climb
"The years punish us as well, I promise you that.",6,3,The Climb
"My stomach remains quite strong, however.",6,3,The Climb
The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities.,6,3,The Climb
Do you deny them?,6,3,The Climb
"Oh, not at all.",6,3,The Climb
A sword swallower through and through.,6,3,The Climb
And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful,6,3,The Climb
woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.,6,3,The Climb
"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?",6,3,The Climb
"Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?",6,3,The Climb
Of course.,6,3,The Climb
And you never...,6,3,The Climb
No.,6,3,The Climb
Not once? Not in any way?,6,3,The Climb
Never.,6,3,The Climb
I congratulate you upon your restraint.,6,3,The Climb
"But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.",6,3,The Climb
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,6,3,The Climb
I wouldn't say that.,6,3,The Climb
"True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but...",6,3,The Climb
"brothers and sisters-- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.",6,3,The Climb
I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.,6,3,The Climb
"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing.",6,3,The Climb
Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to,6,3,The Climb
our new affiliation.,6,3,The Climb
I don't care what people believe.,6,3,The Climb
And neither do you.,6,3,The Climb
"( chuckles ) As an authority on myself, I must disagree.",6,3,The Climb
"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.",6,3,The Climb
"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.",6,3,The Climb
It is a chance we simply cannot take.,6,3,The Climb
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.,6,3,The Climb
All right.,6,3,The Climb
I'll remove it for you.,6,3,The Climb
"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard.",6,3,The Climb
I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows.,6,3,The Climb
He will never marry.,6,3,The Climb
He will never have children.,6,3,The Climb
Oh...,6,3,The Climb
The Tyrell name will fade.,6,3,The Climb
And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.,6,3,The Climb
You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,6,3,The Climb
I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously.,6,3,The Climb
"So, shall I draw up the order?",6,3,The Climb
Or do you consent to this marriage?,6,3,The Climb
It's a rare enough thing-- a man who lives up to his reputation.,6,3,The Climb

Sansa: That's a wonderful pin.,6,3,The Climb
"Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so... I'm very happy about...",6,3,The Climb
"Uh, yes.",6,3,The Climb
I-I am as well. I feel like I'm in a dream.,6,3,The Climb
"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.",6,3,The Climb
"Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?",6,3,The Climb
No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful.,6,3,The Climb
I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.,6,3,The Climb
"It's terrible, isn't it?",6,3,The Climb
The most terrible place there is.,6,3,The Climb
Tyrion: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.,6,3,The Climb
We can have them both killed.,6,3,The Climb
It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.,6,3,The Climb
Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.,6,3,The Climb
Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.,6,3,The Climb
On a boat you built.,6,3,The Climb
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.,6,3,The Climb
I did what I did to protect our family.,6,3,The Climb
I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival.,6,3,The Climb
Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.,6,3,The Climb
I do admit it.,6,3,The Climb
"If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.",6,3,The Climb
Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.,6,3,The Climb
Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.,6,3,The Climb
There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard.,6,3,The Climb
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,6,3,The Climb
The impulse I understand.,6,3,The Climb
He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is.,6,3,The Climb
"So, fair enough. He wants me dead.",6,3,The Climb
But his stupidity?,6,3,The Climb
He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.,6,3,The Climb
But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army.,6,3,The Climb
The boy's an idiot.,6,3,The Climb
What do you want me to say?,6,3,The Climb
I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.,6,3,The Climb
Probably.,6,3,The Climb
But not from Joffrey.,6,3,The Climb
He won't do anything now Father's here.,6,3,The Climb
Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.,6,3,The Climb
Not the Tyrells.,6,3,The Climb
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.,6,3,The Climb
"Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children.",6,3,The Climb
History will be taken from our hands.,6,3,The Climb
"You may escape, at least.",6,3,The Climb
"Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.",6,3,The Climb
"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be?",6,3,The Climb
"He's out there somewhere. Jaime or not, I'm truly f*cked.",6,3,The Climb
Who's going to tell her?,6,3,The Climb
Do you think people will like it?,6,3,The Climb
I don't think they will even notice it.,6,3,The Climb
You're right. It's not my wedding.,6,3,The Climb
"Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.",6,3,The Climb
Loras likes green and gold brocade.,6,3,The Climb
I'm sure he does.,6,3,The Climb
Will they let me invite my family?,6,3,The Climb
They haven't asked my opinion.,6,3,The Climb
But do you think they will?,6,3,The Climb
No.,6,3,The Climb
"Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.",6,3,The Climb
Should I--,6,3,The Climb
"I beg your pardon, my lady.",6,3,The Climb
"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.",6,3,The Climb
I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.,6,3,The Climb
"Yes, it should be quite a wedding.",6,3,The Climb
"I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.",6,3,The Climb
Of course.,6,3,The Climb
"Alone, if I may.",6,3,The Climb
Why do you need to speak to her alone?,6,3,The Climb
Shae.,6,3,The Climb
"Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.",6,3,The Climb
Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late,6,3,The Climb
that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.,6,3,The Climb
"It's all right, really.",6,3,The Climb
How to begin?,6,3,The Climb
It's-- this-- this-- this is awkward.,6,3,The Climb
"1,000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.",6,3,The Climb
"There aren't 1,000 blades. There aren't even 200. I've counted.",6,3,The Climb
"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing.",6,3,The Climb
Yet it has a certain appeal.,6,3,The Climb
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.,6,3,The Climb
Shame you had to settle for your second choice.,6,3,The Climb
"Early days, my friend.",6,3,The Climb
"It is flattering, really... you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.",6,3,The Climb
"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you.",6,3,The Climb
Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?,6,3,The Climb
You're so right.,6,3,The Climb
"For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.",6,3,The Climb
"If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there.",6,3,The Climb
"But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect...",6,3,The Climb
you didn't bring her any enjoyment.,6,3,The Climb
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part.,6,3,The Climb
"Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring.",6,3,The Climb
And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.,6,3,The Climb
I did what I did for the good of the realm.,6,3,The Climb
The realm?,6,3,The Climb
Do you know what the realm is?,6,3,The Climb
It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies.,6,3,The Climb
A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.,6,3,The Climb
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?,6,3,The Climb
Chaos.,6,3,The Climb
A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,6,3,The Climb
Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.,6,3,The Climb
Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.,6,3,The Climb
"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm",6,3,The Climb
or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.,6,3,The Climb

( scoffs ) You and your roads.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Is that how you lot do your fighting?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Most of the time, yes.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
How do the men holding the banners fight?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"They don't, really.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"And the drummers-- is that a great honor, too?",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
So what good are they?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
They help the men march.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
How?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Well, it's-- it's the rhythm.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot?",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
You need help remembering that?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
No.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

It's not all right.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
You think I can't hear you every day?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Filling his head with black magic.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Leave him alone.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
He can speak for himself.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I don't fill his head with anything.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Osha: So what do you talk about?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
What's happening to him and what that means.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Go on, then.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Tell us what it means.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
It's not like that.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I don't want you talking to him anymore.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
We're not going to Castle Black.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
What did you say?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Oh, no. I'm not going back there.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Look at me.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
He wants me to find him.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I don't have my legs anymore.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

You have a family.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
What if I belong in the North?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
What if I fell from that tower for a reason?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Is that what he's telling you?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
That it's all for a reason?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"I wish it were true, little lord.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold sh1t for you or me or anyone.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

A good man.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Bruni, his name was.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I was his and he was mine.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
But one night Bruni disappears.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"People said he left me, but I knew him.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
He'd never leave me.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Not for long.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I knew he'd come back.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
And he did.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
He came in through the back of the hut.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Only it wasn't Bruni.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Not really.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
His skin was pale,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
like a dead man's.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
His eyes bluer than clear sky.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I don't know how I got the knife.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
And he hardly seemed to notice.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I didn't ask the gods what it meant.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I didn't need to.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I already knew.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
It meant the North was no place for men to be.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Not anymore.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Qyburn: How is the pain, my lord?",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Well, we've stymied the corruption.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

Did you fondle one boy too many?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"No, my lord. That's not my weakness.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
What is?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Curiosity.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
The only way to treat disease is to understand disease.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

With their permission?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"Dying paupers, I assume.",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Men with no families to complain.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
to see what was inside.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
"How many men have you killed, my lord?",7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
I don't know.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
50? 100?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

Countless has a nice ring to it.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
And how many lives have you saved?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Half a million.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
The population of King's Landing.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Did you-- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
A fair offer.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
A fair offer. Locke won't take it.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Why not?,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
( sighs ),7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
He feels he's being cheated.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair
They'd be fools to kill her.,7,3,The Bear and the Maiden Fair

And you saw whatever she gave birth to.,8,3,Second Sons
"I never believed,but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you",8,3,Second Sons
"as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?",8,3,Second Sons
( horse neighs ),8,3,Second Sons
( people chatting ),8,3,Second Sons
Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.,8,3,Second Sons
You talk too much.,8,3,Second Sons
She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.,8,3,Second Sons
"8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock.",8,3,Second Sons
( laughs ),8,3,Second Sons
My cock will find a way.,8,3,Second Sons
Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?,8,3,Second Sons
She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.,8,3,Second Sons
"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.",8,3,Second Sons
I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them.,8,3,Second Sons
"And I'm no whore, my friend.",8,3,Second Sons
She sells her sheath and you sell your blade.,8,3,Second Sons
What's the difference?,8,3,Second Sons
I fight for beauty.,8,3,Second Sons
For beauty?,8,3,Second Sons
We fight for gold.,8,3,Second Sons
The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die-- the thrill of f*cking a woman,8,3,Second Sons
who wants to be f*cked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.,8,3,Second Sons
You'll die young.,8,3,Second Sons
Prendahl: What do we do about the dragon girl?,8,3,Second Sons
"We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.",8,3,Second Sons
There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.,8,3,Second Sons
We only have to deal with her.,8,3,Second Sons
She's well guarded.,8,3,Second Sons
Mero: Tonight's a new moon.,8,3,Second Sons
One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.,8,3,Second Sons
Which one of us?,8,3,Second Sons
"Close your eyes, love.",8,3,Second Sons
Three coins.,8,3,Second Sons
"A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos.",8,3,Second Sons
The Braavosi does the deed.,8,3,Second Sons
"One for each of us, darling.",8,3,Second Sons
No peeking.,8,3,Second Sons
Do you hear me?,8,3,Second Sons
Follow my voice. I'm right here.,8,3,Second Sons
You have something for me?,8,3,Second Sons
Valar morghulis.,8,3,Second Sons
( knock at door ),8,3,Second Sons
( sighs ),8,3,Second Sons
Lady Sansa.,8,3,Second Sons
"You look very handsome, my lord.",8,3,Second Sons
"Oh, yes.",8,3,Second Sons
The husband of your dreams.,8,3,Second Sons
But you do look glorious.,8,3,Second Sons
Perhaps we could have a moment alone.,8,3,Second Sons
Do you mind?,8,3,Second Sons
"Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?",8,3,Second Sons
"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.",8,3,Second Sons
"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.",8,3,Second Sons
"No, don't.",8,3,Second Sons
You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore.,8,3,Second Sons
You won't be a prisoner after today.,8,3,Second Sons
You'll be my wife.,8,3,Second Sons
I suppose that's a different kind of prison.,8,3,Second Sons
I just wanted to say--,8,3,Second Sons
I'm just trying to say very badly--,8,3,Second Sons
I just-- just want to say I know how you feel.,8,3,Second Sons
"I doubt that very much, my lord.",8,3,Second Sons
You're right.,8,3,Second Sons
I have no idea how you feel.,8,3,Second Sons
And you have no idea how I feel.,8,3,Second Sons
"But I promise you one thing, my lady.",8,3,Second Sons
I won't ever hurt you.,8,3,Second Sons
Do you drink wine?,8,3,Second Sons
When I have to.,8,3,Second Sons
"Well, today you have to.",8,3,Second Sons
"Margaery: You look radiant, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
Radiant? Why radiant?,8,3,Second Sons
It's the word that came to mind.,8,3,Second Sons
( chuckles ),8,3,Second Sons
We're going to be sisters soon.,8,3,Second Sons
We should be friends.,8,3,Second Sons
"You're a musical girl, aren't you?",8,3,Second Sons
I imagine you have a lovely voice.,8,3,Second Sons
"A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.",8,3,Second Sons
"Ah, but you know the song ""The Rains of Castamere""?",8,3,Second Sons
Of course. They play it so often here at court.,8,3,Second Sons
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?,8,3,Second Sons
"Not as well as you, I'm sure.",8,3,Second Sons
House Reyne was a powerful family.,8,3,Second Sons
Very wealthy.,8,3,Second Sons
The second wealthiest in Westeros.,8,3,Second Sons
Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?,8,3,Second Sons
"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung.",8,3,Second Sons
"If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest.",8,3,Second Sons
You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.,8,3,Second Sons
So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any,8,3,Second Sons
"my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father.",8,3,Second Sons
Do you know where House Reyne is now?,8,3,Second Sons
Gone.,8,3,Second Sons
Gone.,8,3,Second Sons
A gentle word.,8,3,Second Sons
Why not say slaughtered?,8,3,Second Sons
"Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.",8,3,Second Sons
I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock.,8,3,Second Sons
My father let them rot up there all summer.,8,3,Second Sons
It was a long summer.,8,3,Second Sons
"""And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.""",8,3,Second Sons
"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.",8,3,Second Sons
( doors open ),8,3,Second Sons
What are you doing?,8,3,Second Sons
Your father's gone.,8,3,Second Sons
"As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.",8,3,Second Sons
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.,8,3,Second Sons
( light laughter ),8,3,Second Sons
( snickers ),8,3,Second Sons
( laughter ),8,3,Second Sons
( laughter stops ),8,3,Second Sons
Could you...,8,3,Second Sons
Thank you.,8,3,Second Sons
"Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men",8,3,Second Sons
"to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.",8,3,Second Sons
Have you ever seen one like it?,8,3,Second Sons
I've never seen anything like any of this.,8,3,Second Sons
Not in my life.,8,3,Second Sons
"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth?",8,3,Second Sons
"When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.",8,3,Second Sons
In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.,8,3,Second Sons
We knew it wasn't chicken.,8,3,Second Sons
( liquid pouring ),8,3,Second Sons
"Here, taste this.",8,3,Second Sons
You think I'm trying to poison you?,8,3,Second Sons
That's good.,8,3,Second Sons
That's really good.,8,3,Second Sons
Where do you think it's from?,8,3,Second Sons
I couldn't even guess.,8,3,Second Sons
"Doesn't matter, does it?",8,3,Second Sons
It's the real thing or it's not.,8,3,Second Sons
You only need a tongue to tell the difference.,8,3,Second Sons
"Go on, have some more.",8,3,Second Sons
You still don't trust it.,8,3,Second Sons
You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.,8,3,Second Sons
"That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.",8,3,Second Sons
There are no mistakes.,8,3,Second Sons
Not for us.,8,3,Second Sons
I'm a mistake.,8,3,Second Sons
I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.,8,3,Second Sons
Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.,8,3,Second Sons
He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand.,8,3,Second Sons
And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.,8,3,Second Sons
We're both a part of His plan.,8,3,Second Sons
He wants this for us.,8,3,Second Sons
"No, He demands this of us.",8,3,Second Sons
I don't understand.,8,3,Second Sons
This-- this doesn't seem very religious.,8,3,Second Sons
According to whom?,8,3,Second Sons
The Silent Sisters?,8,3,Second Sons
"With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up c**ts?",8,3,Second Sons
What have their gods done for you?,8,3,Second Sons
Hmm?,8,3,Second Sons
"When you pray to them, what's their answer?",8,3,Second Sons
A god is real or he's not.,8,3,Second Sons
You only need eyes to see.,8,3,Second Sons
Death is coming for everyone and everything.,8,3,Second Sons
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.,8,3,Second Sons
"And we can stop it, you and I.",8,3,Second Sons
( breathing heavily ),8,3,Second Sons
Let me show you what you have inside you.,8,3,Second Sons
Come fight death with me.,8,3,Second Sons
( both moaning ),8,3,Second Sons
What are you doing?,8,3,Second Sons
You have to trust me.,8,3,Second Sons
What--?,8,3,Second Sons
Get it away.,8,3,Second Sons
Get it off me.,8,3,Second Sons
"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.",8,3,Second Sons
Why are you doing this?,8,3,Second Sons
I told you there's power in the blood of kings.,8,3,Second Sons
And you have so much blood.,8,3,Second Sons
"No. No, no, no, no!",8,3,Second Sons
Not there. Not there!,8,3,Second Sons

You can blame Ser Davos.,8,3,Second Sons
He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.,8,3,Second Sons
He wanted a demonstration.,8,3,Second Sons
"Gendry: Please. Please, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
My lord!,8,3,Second Sons
( cries out ),8,3,Second Sons
The usurper Robb Stark.,8,3,Second Sons
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.,8,3,Second Sons
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.,8,3,Second Sons
( music playing ),8,3,Second Sons
( people chatting ),8,3,Second Sons
So their son will be your nephew.,8,3,Second Sons
"After you're wed to Cersei, of course.",8,3,Second Sons
And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law.,8,3,Second Sons
"When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son",8,3,Second Sons
will be Loras' nephew?,8,3,Second Sons
Grandson? I'm not sure.,8,3,Second Sons
But your brother will become your father-in-law.,8,3,Second Sons
That much is beyond dispute.,8,3,Second Sons
( snorts ),8,3,Second Sons
"Will you pardon me, my lord?",8,3,Second Sons
Of course. Of course. En-- enjoy.,8,3,Second Sons
Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.,8,3,Second Sons
I've got a lifetime for that.,8,3,Second Sons
Stay. You seem rather drunk. Rather less than I plan to be.,8,3,Second Sons
Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?,8,3,Second Sons
Tywin: This isn't about your wedding.,8,3,Second Sons
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.,8,3,Second Sons
"Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.",8,3,Second Sons
And?,8,3,Second Sons
"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.",8,3,Second Sons
What did you once call me?,8,3,Second Sons
A drunken little lust-filled beast.,8,3,Second Sons
More than once.,8,3,Second Sons
There you have it.,8,3,Second Sons
"Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things.",8,3,Second Sons
I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.,8,3,Second Sons
"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable,",8,3,Second Sons
but you will do your duty.,8,3,Second Sons
Well...,8,3,Second Sons
My father once told me-- ,8,3,Second Sons
Nobody cares what your father once told you.,8,3,Second Sons
"Congratulations, my lady.",8,3,Second Sons
"Thank you, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
"Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.",8,3,Second Sons
"It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day.",8,3,Second Sons
"Yes, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you.,8,3,Second Sons
Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.,8,3,Second Sons
How'd you like that?,8,3,Second Sons
You wouldn't?,8,3,Second Sons
That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.,8,3,Second Sons
( claps ),8,3,Second Sons
Time for the bedding ceremony.,8,3,Second Sons
( cheering ),8,3,Second Sons
There will be no bedding ceremony.,8,3,Second Sons
"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?",8,3,Second Sons
"Come, everyone.",8,3,Second Sons
Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.,8,3,Second Sons
Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer.,8,3,Second Sons
"Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.",8,3,Second Sons
There will be no bedding ceremony.,8,3,Second Sons
There will be if I command it.,8,3,Second Sons
Then you'll be f*cking your own bride with a wooden cock.,8,3,Second Sons
What did you say?,8,3,Second Sons
What did you say?!,8,3,Second Sons
"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.,8,3,Second Sons
( laughs ),8,3,Second Sons
"A bad joke, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.,8,3,Second Sons
Mine is so small.,8,3,Second Sons
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.,8,3,Second Sons
"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
Tyrion: I am.,8,3,Second Sons
Guilty.,8,3,Second Sons
But-- but it is my wedding night.,8,3,Second Sons
"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.",8,3,Second Sons
I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it.,8,3,Second Sons
"But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?",8,3,Second Sons
"Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.",8,3,Second Sons
"Is that wise, my lord?",8,3,Second Sons
"Tyrion, Sansa.",8,3,Second Sons
My name is Tyrion.,8,3,Second Sons
"Is that wise, Tyrion?",8,3,Second Sons
Nothing was ever wiser.,8,3,Second Sons
Astoundingly long.,8,3,Second Sons
What?,8,3,Second Sons
Neck. You have one.,8,3,Second Sons
How old are you exactly?,8,3,Second Sons
14.,8,3,Second Sons
"Well, talk won't make you any older.",8,3,Second Sons
My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.,8,3,Second Sons
Stop.,8,3,Second Sons
I can't.,8,3,Second Sons
"I could, I won't.",8,3,Second Sons
But your father--,8,3,Second Sons
"If my father wants someone to get f*cked, I know where he can start.",8,3,Second Sons
I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.,8,3,Second Sons
What if I never want you to?,8,3,Second Sons
And so my watch begins.,8,3,Second Sons

( chatter ),8,3,Second Sons

"Yes, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
How can anyone speak 19 languages?,8,3,Second Sons
It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.,8,3,Second Sons
"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope--",8,3,Second Sons
what do you mean reasonably well?,8,3,Second Sons
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.,8,3,Second Sons
So guttural and harsh.,8,3,Second Sons
Athjahakar.,8,3,Second Sons
Athjahaka.,8,3,Second Sons
Ath-ja-hakar.,8,3,Second Sons
Athjahakar.,8,3,Second Sons
"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.",8,3,Second Sons
"Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.",8,3,Second Sons
The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.,8,3,Second Sons
It is the only proper language for poetry.,8,3,Second Sons
( Missandei gasps ),8,3,Second Sons
No screaming or she dies.,8,3,Second Sons
What do you want?,8,3,Second Sons
You.,8,3,Second Sons
Let her go.,8,3,Second Sons
"Don't scream, lovely girl.",8,3,Second Sons
You were sent here to kill me?,8,3,Second Sons
( chuckles ),8,3,Second Sons
So why haven't you?,8,3,Second Sons
I don't want to.,8,3,Second Sons
What do your captains have to say about that?,8,3,Second Sons
You should ask them.,8,3,Second Sons
Why?,8,3,Second Sons
We had philosophical differences.,8,3,Second Sons
Over what?,8,3,Second Sons
Your beauty.,8,3,Second Sons
It meant more to me than it did to them.,8,3,Second Sons
You're a strange man.,8,3,Second Sons
I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.,8,3,Second Sons
I only do what I want to do.,8,3,Second Sons
And this is supposed to impress me?,8,3,Second Sons
Yes.,8,3,Second Sons
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?,8,3,Second Sons
They ordered me to murder you.,8,3,Second Sons
I told them I preferred not to.,8,3,Second Sons
They told me I had no choice.,8,3,Second Sons
I told them I am Daario Naharis.,8,3,Second Sons
I always have a choice.,8,3,Second Sons
They drew their swords and I drew mine.,8,3,Second Sons
Will you fight for me?,8,3,Second Sons
Swear to me.,8,3,Second Sons
The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.,8,3,Second Sons

( baby fusses ),8,3,Second Sons
He winked at me before.,8,3,Second Sons
I doubt it.,8,3,Second Sons
I saw him wink at me.,8,3,Second Sons
He blinked.,8,3,Second Sons
I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.,8,3,Second Sons
A what?,8,3,Second Sons
"Well, I mean, there's no real difference.",8,3,Second Sons
A wink is on purpose.,8,3,Second Sons
You thought of a name yet?,8,3,Second Sons
It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.,8,3,Second Sons
Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?,8,3,Second Sons
What? No.,8,3,Second Sons
This is just the way I talk.,8,3,Second Sons
I'll build that fire.,8,3,Second Sons

Maybe that's not--,8,3,Second Sons
Mormont.,8,3,Second Sons
"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.",8,3,Second Sons
Why is it a last name?,8,3,Second Sons
"Well, it's a family name.",8,3,Second Sons
"For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.",8,3,Second Sons
Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name.,8,3,Second Sons
You see? So my father is also a Tarly.,8,3,Second Sons
"His name is Samwell Tarly, too?",8,3,Second Sons
"No, Randyll Tarly.",8,3,Second Sons
Randyll is a handsome name.,8,3,Second Sons
Please don't name him Randyll.,8,3,Second Sons

You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
So Casterly Rock...,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
I'm asking your advice.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
We have enough men?,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
If Walder Frey cooperates.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle... we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Or worse.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Walder: My honored guests... be welcome within my walls and at my table.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

Any man would be luckyto have any one of you.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

Doesn't drop an inch.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Your king says he betrayed me for love.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
And I can respect that.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

It's a back gate.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"Your men, but not you?",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Daario: I have no interest in slaves.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
A man cannot make love to property.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
This is where we enter the city.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Very few guards. They know me.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
They let me inside--,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Then comes the army.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
The masters of Yunkaiwill pay you your feeand you won't have to split it three ways,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
You have a very suspicious mind.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
You command the Unsullied.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

"We're west of Castle Black,but the Nightfort's closest to us.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
It was the first castle on the Wall.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Too big.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Impossible to maintain.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
No one's used it in centuries most likely.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort,if one knows how to find it, which, it just",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"so happens, I do.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
How do you know all that?,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
I read about it in a very old book.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
You know all that from staring at marks on paper?,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Yes.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
You're like a wizard.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

Dead rats don't squeak.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"You're so dangerous, aren't you?",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Saying scary things to little girls.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Killing little boys and old people.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
A real hard man you are.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
More than anyone you know.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
You're wrong. I know a killer.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
A real killer.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
That so?,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
You'd be like a kitten to him.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
He'd kill you with his little finger.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

"The Gift, I think.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Brandon the Builder gave all this landsouth of the Wallto the Night's Watch for their sustenance,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
and support.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Maester Luwin taught me that.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
It's good land and there's no war up here.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

( screeching ),9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Only one old man and eight good horses.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
What's one old man doing with eight horses?,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
He breeds them for the Watch.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
How's he keep folks from stealing them?,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
The Watch protects him.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Not today they don't.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
"He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.",9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Tormund: And proper steel.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Let's carve him up.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
We just take the horses and go.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
The old man's no threat.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
I keep telling you.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
He's an old man.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
I hope so.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere
Killing crows in their castle is tough.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

Of course you can.,9,3,The Rains of Castamere

Hmm.,10,3,Mhysa
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.,10,3,Mhysa
What are you doing?,10,3,Mhysa
I have a list.,10,3,Mhysa
A list of people you mean to kill? For laughing at me?,10,3,Mhysa
Do I look like Joffrey to you?,10,3,Mhysa
"No, death seems a bit extreme.",10,3,Mhysa
"Fear of death, on the other hand... You should learn to ignore them.",10,3,Mhysa
"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you.",10,3,Mhysa
"I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp. You're a Lannister.",10,3,Mhysa
I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark. The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.,10,3,Mhysa
We're perfect for each other.,10,3,Mhysa
( chuckles ),10,3,Mhysa
So how should we punish them?,10,3,Mhysa
Who? Whom?,10,3,Mhysa
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.,10,3,Mhysa
Ah.,10,3,Mhysa
I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.,10,3,Mhysa
Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.,10,3,Mhysa
I hear that you're a pervert.,10,3,Mhysa
I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.,10,3,Mhysa

"We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.",10,3,Mhysa
Lady Sansa!,10,3,Mhysa
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.,10,3,Mhysa
Why sheep shift?,10,3,Mhysa
That's the vulgar word for dung.,10,3,Mhysa
My lady...,10,3,Mhysa
"Well, you asked me.",10,3,Mhysa

That's him!,10,3,Mhysa

( laughing ),10,3,Mhysa
And his bitch mother.,10,3,Mhysa
Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head.,10,3,Mhysa
I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.,10,3,Mhysa

A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.,10,3,Mhysa
"Yes, I did.",10,3,Mhysa
I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.,10,3,Mhysa
Tyrion: No.,10,3,Mhysa
She is no longer yours to torment.,10,3,Mhysa
"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.",10,3,Mhysa
"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.",10,3,Mhysa
I could have your tongue out for saying that.,10,3,Mhysa
Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.,10,3,Mhysa
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.,10,3,Mhysa
"Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.",10,3,Mhysa
I am the king! I will punish you.,10,3,Mhysa
"Any man who must say, ""I am the king"" is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.",10,3,Mhysa

The king is tired. See him to his chambers.,10,3,Mhysa
Come along.,10,3,Mhysa
I'm not tired.,10,3,Mhysa
We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.,10,3,Mhysa

I'm not tired!,10,3,Mhysa
Come.,10,3,Mhysa
Not you.,10,3,Mhysa
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.,10,3,Mhysa
You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.,10,3,Mhysa
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.,10,3,Mhysa
You really think a crown gives you power?,10,3,Mhysa
No.,10,3,Mhysa
I think armies give you power.,10,3,Mhysa
Mm-hmm.,10,3,Mhysa
"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.",10,3,Mhysa
Mm-hmm.,10,3,Mhysa
"Oh, I know.",10,3,Mhysa
"Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance.",10,3,Mhysa
"Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?",10,3,Mhysa
No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances. Which he got from me.,10,3,Mhysa
Do you disapprove?,10,3,Mhysa
I'm all for cheating. This is war.,10,3,Mhysa
"But to slaughter them at a wedding... Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.",10,3,Mhysa
So that's why you did it?,10,3,Mhysa
To save lives?,10,3,Mhysa
To end the war. To protect the family.,10,3,Mhysa
"Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one.",10,3,Mhysa
"I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.",10,3,Mhysa

All the Stark men are dead.,10,3,Mhysa
Winterfell is a ruin.,10,3,Mhysa
Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.,10,3,Mhysa
I believe you still have some work to do on that score.,10,3,Mhysa
Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?,10,3,Mhysa
"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.",10,3,Mhysa
I will not rape her.,10,3,Mhysa
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?,10,3,Mhysa
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.,10,3,Mhysa
The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first.,10,3,Mhysa
A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.,10,3,Mhysa
Does that amuse you?,10,3,Mhysa
"No, it's a very good lesson.",10,3,Mhysa
Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.,10,3,Mhysa
"Easy for me, is it?",10,3,Mhysa
When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?,10,3,Mhysa
The day that you were born.,10,3,Mhysa
"I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.",10,3,Mhysa

You'd rather be out there?,10,3,Mhysa
There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.,10,3,Mhysa
I always quite liked the horrible stories.,10,3,Mhysa
So did I.,10,3,Mhysa
Once.,10,3,Mhysa
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?,10,3,Mhysa
No. Who's he?,10,3,Mhysa
"Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something,",10,3,Mhysa
I don't remember.,10,3,Mhysa
"When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.",10,3,Mhysa
( chuckles ),10,3,Mhysa
If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-- It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook,10,3,Mhysa
or for serving the king's son in a pie.,10,3,Mhysa
He killed a guest beneath his roof.,10,3,Mhysa
( distant clatter ),10,3,Mhysa

( rats squeaking ),10,3,Mhysa
"""The late Walder Frey,"" old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.",10,3,Mhysa
He thought he was witty.,10,3,Mhysa
"Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun.",10,3,Mhysa
( laughs ),10,3,Mhysa
The Blackfish escaped.,10,3,Mhysa
An old man on the run with no allies.,10,3,Mhysa
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.,10,3,Mhysa
Who does he have?,10,3,Mhysa
As you say.,10,3,Mhysa
"They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me.",10,3,Mhysa
"Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.",10,3,Mhysa
"People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?",10,3,Mhysa
You'll be needing a new young girl.,10,3,Mhysa
"Yeah. Got that to look forward to. And you, the Warden of the North.",10,3,Mhysa
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.,10,3,Mhysa
Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.,10,3,Mhysa
He ignored my advice at every turn.,10,3,Mhysa
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant... Calling himself the Young Wolf.,10,3,Mhysa
How's that for pomposity?,10,3,Mhysa

Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?,10,3,Mhysa
At some point perhaps.,10,3,Mhysa
But Winterfell's in ruins.,10,3,Mhysa
Yeah.,10,3,Mhysa
What happened up there?,10,3,Mhysa
"I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.",10,3,Mhysa
I sent my b*st*rd Ramsay to root him out.,10,3,Mhysa
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.,10,3,Mhysa
Oh. And?,10,3,Mhysa
Ramsay delivered the terms.,10,3,Mhysa
The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded.,10,3,Mhysa
But Ramsay-- well... Ramsay has his own way of doing things.,10,3,Mhysa
"Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock.",10,3,Mhysa
What?,10,3,Mhysa
No.,10,3,Mhysa
Pork sausage.,10,3,Mhysa
You think I'm some sort of savage?,10,3,Mhysa
People talk about phantom limbs.,10,3,Mhysa
An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.,10,3,Mhysa
So I've always wondered... do eunuchs have a phantom cock?,10,3,Mhysa
"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?",10,3,Mhysa

How close to the Red Keep were you?,10,3,Mhysa
The sh1t that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door,10,3,Mhysa
on Gin Alley.,10,3,Mhysa
Gin Alley.,10,3,Mhysa
"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights?",10,3,Mhysa
Pfft.,10,3,Mhysa
You lived in the fancy part of town.,10,3,Mhysa
And here we are now.,10,3,Mhysa
Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.,10,3,Mhysa
"Yeah, we've come a long way.",10,3,Mhysa
"We're all the same, really.",10,3,Mhysa
She went to great pains to point that out to me.,10,3,Mhysa
"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?",10,3,Mhysa
You're me.,10,3,Mhysa
"Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really.",10,3,Mhysa
"And then she comes at you-- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?",10,3,Mhysa
"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.",10,3,Mhysa
( both chuckle ),10,3,Mhysa
So how'd you become a lord?,10,3,Mhysa
"Oh, that's a long story.",10,3,Mhysa
"Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.",10,3,Mhysa
Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship.,10,3,Mhysa
And this.,10,3,Mhysa
You see?,10,3,Mhysa
Highborns.,10,3,Mhysa
I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.,10,3,Mhysa
Why did you?,10,3,Mhysa
I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of sh1t every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.,10,3,Mhysa
Does he?,10,3,Mhysa
He's dead.,10,3,Mhysa
How'd he die?,10,3,Mhysa
Following me.,10,3,Mhysa
( seabirds screeching ),10,3,Mhysa
( bells dinging ),10,3,Mhysa
When did you come to this strange country?,10,3,Mhysa
When I was 13.,10,3,Mhysa
You were only a child.,10,3,Mhysa
I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.,10,3,Mhysa
"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know.",10,3,Mhysa
"He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money.",10,3,Mhysa
Now it's just the drinking. And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot. She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault. I love that girl. I would kill for her.,10,3,Mhysa
Do you think that makes it easier for me?,10,3,Mhysa
"No, I expect not.",10,3,Mhysa
She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.,10,3,Mhysa
"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be",10,3,Mhysa
their countrymen.,10,3,Mhysa
If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister--,10,3,Mhysa
I have a name.,10,3,Mhysa
You have one name.,10,3,Mhysa
As do I.,10,3,Mhysa
Here only the family name matters.,10,3,Mhysa
"What do you want from me, Lord Varys?",10,3,Mhysa
Diamonds.,10,3,Mhysa
"I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself.",10,3,Mhysa
Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.,10,3,Mhysa
"You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here.",10,3,Mhysa
The mysterious foreign beauty.,10,3,Mhysa
You'll have suitors lining up.,10,3,Mhysa
Why do you want me to leave?,10,3,Mhysa
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place.,10,3,Mhysa
"He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name.",10,3,Mhysa
And you-- you are a complication.,10,3,Mhysa
I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you,10,3,Mhysa
to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him.,10,3,Mhysa
"This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here... while there's still time.",10,3,Mhysa
Lord Varys.,10,3,Mhysa
"If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.",10,3,Mhysa
Keep up.,10,3,Mhysa
"I don't think I can, my lord. It's not easy being drunk all the time.",10,3,Mhysa
Everyone would do it if it were easy.,10,3,Mhysa
( footsteps approaching ),10,3,Mhysa
Leave.,10,3,Mhysa
"So, enjoying married life?",10,3,Mhysa
An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.,10,3,Mhysa
She doesn't deserve this.,10,3,Mhysa
Deserve? Be careful with that.,10,3,Mhysa
Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.,10,3,Mhysa
There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.,10,3,Mhysa
( chuckles ),10,3,Mhysa
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?,10,3,Mhysa
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.,10,3,Mhysa
I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.,10,3,Mhysa
You're not me.,10,3,Mhysa
You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child. ,10,3,Mhysa
So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?,10,3,Mhysa
So she can have some happiness in her life.,10,3,Mhysa
You have children.,10,3,Mhysa
How happy would you say you are?,10,3,Mhysa
"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.",10,3,Mhysa
They're the reason I'm alive.,10,3,Mhysa
Even Joffrey?,10,3,Mhysa
Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him.,10,3,Mhysa
His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow.,10,3,Mhysa
You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.,10,3,Mhysa
"""We should have known. Even then we should have known.""",10,3,Mhysa
"It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey-- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own.",10,3,Mhysa
How long does it go on?,10,3,Mhysa
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.,10,3,Mhysa
"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.",10,3,Mhysa
Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.,10,3,Mhysa
( man laughing ),10,3,Mhysa

Sounded like a cow in heat.,10,3,Mhysa
"Aye, not for long.",10,3,Mhysa
That's right.,10,3,Mhysa
Black Walder shut her up right quick.,10,3,Mhysa
None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.,10,3,Mhysa
"I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.",10,3,Mhysa
You sewed it on?,10,3,Mhysa
I did.,10,3,Mhysa
"I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one.",10,3,Mhysa
It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott.,10,3,Mhysa
"Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it.",10,3,Mhysa
What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone.,10,3,Mhysa
Give it a nice firm mooring and--,10,3,Mhysa
What do you want?,10,3,Mhysa
Mind if I keep warm?,10,3,Mhysa
f*ck off.,10,3,Mhysa
But I'm hungry.,10,3,Mhysa
Does f*ck off mean something different where you're from?,10,3,Mhysa
I've got money.,10,3,Mhysa

But I have to go home now.,10,3,Mhysa

"He's not my child, Maester Aemon.",10,3,Mhysa
She's one of Craster's wives.,10,3,Mhysa
I remember every word of the oath.,10,3,Mhysa
Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.,10,3,Mhysa
The realms of men.,10,3,Mhysa
That means her as well as us.,10,3,Mhysa
"We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls, 700 feet high to keep out men.",10,3,Mhysa
"The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.",10,3,Mhysa
I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.,10,3,Mhysa

"Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.",10,3,Mhysa

Did you just bow?,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
"Apologies, Your Grace.",2,4,The Lion and the Rose
I never did master the curtsy.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose

A shame.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose

"Your Grace, I am a man of learning.",2,4,The Lion and the Rose
My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose

I want you to leave my presence.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
Leave this wedding right now.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose

No?,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
How tolerant of you.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities.",2,4,The Lion and the Rose

Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
People everywhere have their differences.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose
In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful.,2,4,The Lion and the Rose

King Robert was strong.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him.,3,4,Breaker of Chains

Declared themselves enemies of the throne.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Now they are our strongest allies.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
A wildling army marches on the Wall.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
You're saying you need us?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
That must be hard for you to admit.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
We need each other.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.,3,4,Breaker of Chains

"I've heard nothing, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
I suppose that's a good thing.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
What are they saying about me out there?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"No, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
You didn't?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"No. Gods, no.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Trial in a fortnight.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Have they announcedthe judges yet?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Your father.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Of course.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Mace Tyrell.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Oberyn?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Give it to my father.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Anyone who might testify on your behalf.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Oh, I can call my own witnesses?",3,4,Breaker of Chains
How generous of them.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Very well, my wife.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Sansa.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"My lord, she's gone.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Gone?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
- No one's seen her since the wedding.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
You don't think she...,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"No one had more causeto kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Podrick.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Yes, my lord?",3,4,Breaker of Chains
They'll be following you now.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Who will?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
I don't know. They.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
They. The ominous they.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
The man pulling the strings.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Or woman. My father.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Any other witnesses, my lord?",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Varys could vouch for me if he dared.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
He's already been called as a witness for the queen.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Of course. Fetch Bronn.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
I have a job for him.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I've already asked, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
They won't let him see you.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Why not?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
He's under investigation himself.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I'll ask, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"There's something else, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Ser Podrick Payne?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Has a nice ring to it.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
What did you tell him?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I didn't tell them anything, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Are you going to accept their offer?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
My lord.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"You've been good to me, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
They'll want an answer before that.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"I already gave them an answer, my lord.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
I will not have you dying on my behalf.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Do you hear me?,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
My lord.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
"Pod, I am giving you an order.",3,4,Breaker of Chains
Go and find my brother.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
Tell him I need him.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late.,3,4,Breaker of Chains

Justice can wait.,3,4,Breaker of Chains
It's not about justice.,3,4,Breaker of Chains

I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.,4,4,Oathkeeper

But you need to act quickly.,4,4,Oathkeeper

She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"And by the time you're married, it'll be too late.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"Luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"Well, he could have done.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"He could have done, but he didn't.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"You don't know, Grandmother.",4,4,Oathkeeper
But I do know.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?",4,4,Oathkeeper
What?,4,4,Oathkeeper
I don't understand.,4,4,Oathkeeper

And again.,4,4,Oathkeeper
(laughs),4,4,Oathkeeper
Very nice. Good.,4,4,Oathkeeper
A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.,4,4,Oathkeeper
First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Let's see what you can do.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"Olly, you just watch for now.",4,4,Oathkeeper
I can fight.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Have you ever held a sword before?,4,4,Oathkeeper
I was the best archer in our hamlet.,4,4,Oathkeeper
(men laugh),4,4,Oathkeeper
I was!,4,4,Oathkeeper
I believe you.,4,4,Oathkeeper
We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.,4,4,Oathkeeper

You two.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"Take it slow, try and disarm each other.",4,4,Oathkeeper
(shouts),4,4,Oathkeeper
(groans),4,4,Oathkeeper
You know how to fight.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You could have gone easier on him.,4,4,Oathkeeper
He wouldn't have learned anything that way.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Alliser:Lord Snow.,4,4,Oathkeeper
What do you think you're doing?,4,4,Oathkeeper
Grenn and I were helping them.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Grenn's a ranger.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You're a steward.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, Someone has to train them.",4,4,Oathkeeper
And that someone isn't you.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Go find a chamber pot to empty.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Go on. Do it.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You traitor's b*st*rd.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Give me an excuse.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Mormont's not here to protect you now.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Get back to work.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Now!,4,4,Oathkeeper
I said now!,4,4,Oathkeeper
The b*st*rd's well-liked.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You're not.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You think I care if they like me?,4,4,Oathkeeper
We're at war.,4,4,Oathkeeper
For now.,4,4,Oathkeeper
But you can't be acting commander forever.,4,4,Oathkeeper
There will be a choosing.,4,4,Oathkeeper
The old maester will insist on it.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You might reconsider his request to march on Craster's.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Let the mutineers take care of Snow.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"A b*st*rd, eh?",4,4,Oathkeeper
Took you for highborn.,4,4,Oathkeeper
My father was highborn.,4,4,Oathkeeper

You fight well.,4,4,Oathkeeper
What brought you up here?,4,4,Oathkeeper
A sense of duty.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.,4,4,Oathkeeper
(laughs),4,4,Oathkeeper
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I was stupid enough to get caught.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Chose the Wall over losing my hand.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn c**ts here.,4,4,Oathkeeper

 So one?,4,4,Oathkeeper
You have one man guarding the future king?,4,4,Oathkeeper
I promise you Tommen's safe.,4,4,Oathkeeper
We're protecting him.,4,4,Oathkeeper
The way you protected Joffrey?,4,4,Oathkeeper
Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?,4,4,Oathkeeper
What?,4,4,Oathkeeper
I've been wondering for months.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Why did she set you free?,4,4,Oathkeeper
You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.,4,4,Oathkeeper
She hoped or did you promise?,4,4,Oathkeeper
"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.",4,4,Oathkeeper
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I wanted to get back to you.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Should I have told her to f*ck off?,4,4,Oathkeeper
"You didn't mean it, then?",4,4,Oathkeeper
You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?,4,4,Oathkeeper
Catelyn Stark's dead.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?",4,4,Oathkeeper
I know you went to see Tyrion.,4,4,Oathkeeper
That creature who murdered our son.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I had to see him.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I had to know for myself.,4,4,Oathkeeper
And?,4,4,Oathkeeper
"He didn't do it, Cersei.",4,4,Oathkeeper
You've always pitied him.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Our poor little brother.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Abused by the world.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Despised by his father and sister.,4,4,Oathkeeper
He'd kill us all if he could.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.,4,4,Oathkeeper

(door closes),4,4,Oathkeeper
How did you get past the Kingsguard?,4,4,Oathkeeper
Kingsguard.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I don't think you're supposed to be here.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.",4,4,Oathkeeper
Word has it I'm to be your bride.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day?,4,4,Oathkeeper
"Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another.",4,4,Oathkeeper
Don't you think?,4,4,Oathkeeper
Yes.,4,4,Oathkeeper
But if my mother found out--,4,4,Oathkeeper
It can be our secret.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Hmm?,4,4,Oathkeeper
"If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"So, Your Grace...",4,4,Oathkeeper
Yes?,4,4,Oathkeeper
Tell me a secret.,4,4,Oathkeeper
(cat meows),4,4,Oathkeeper
(laughs),4,4,Oathkeeper
Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?,4,4,Oathkeeper
That's Ser Pounce.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Very handsome.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Joffrey didn't like him.,4,4,Oathkeeper
He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.,4,4,Oathkeeper
That's very cruel.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You don't strike me as cruel.,4,4,Oathkeeper
No.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I don't think I am.,4,4,Oathkeeper
That's a relief.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Because you know what happens when we marry?,4,4,Oathkeeper
We say our vows in front of the high septon.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"And after the ceremony, there's a feast.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"When we marry, I become yours.",4,4,Oathkeeper
Forever.,4,4,Oathkeeper
It's getting late.,4,4,Oathkeeper

Mmm.,4,4,Oathkeeper
It's yours.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I can't accept this.,4,4,Oathkeeper
It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Lady Stark's dead.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.",4,4,Oathkeeper

I have one more gift.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I don't need a squire.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Of course you do.,4,4,Oathkeeper
He'll slow me down.,4,4,Oathkeeper

It's chivalry.,4,4,Oathkeeper

I should never have taken her away.,4,4,Oathkeeper
She wasn't safe here.,4,4,Oathkeeper
She's not safe out there.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I should have known.,4,4,Oathkeeper
You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.",4,4,Oathkeeper
Castle Black could be next.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I should go back for Gilly.,4,4,Oathkeeper
We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.,4,4,Oathkeeper
And I remember who came after me and brought me home.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.",4,4,Oathkeeper
I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.,4,4,Oathkeeper
I tried.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"Really, I did.",4,4,Oathkeeper
How fast could they travel?,4,4,Oathkeeper
A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?,4,4,Oathkeeper
I don't know.,4,4,Oathkeeper
They'd pass wildling villages.,4,4,Oathkeeper
They could try to find shelter at one of them.,4,4,Oathkeeper
The wildlings have joined up with Mance.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Every village or sheltered place will be deserted.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Except...,4,4,Oathkeeper

"There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this.",4,4,Oathkeeper
Our survival may depend onus getting to these mutineers before Mance does.,4,4,Oathkeeper
They know the Wall.,4,4,Oathkeeper
They know our defenses.,4,4,Oathkeeper
"If Mance learns what they know, we're lost.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"But if that's not enough, then consider this.",4,4,Oathkeeper
"If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.",4,4,Oathkeeper
He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Stabbed in the back by cowards.,4,4,Oathkeeper
He deserved far better.,4,4,Oathkeeper
All we can give him now is justice.,4,4,Oathkeeper
Who will join me?,4,4,Oathkeeper
I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.,4,4,Oathkeeper

He would have been your nightmare.,5,4,First of His Name
"Your Grace, I feel--",5,4,First of His Name
You knew exactly what he was.,5,4,First of His Name
"I did, too.",5,4,First of His Name
You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.,5,4,First of His Name
Doesn't matter what they do.,5,4,First of His Name
"And what he did, it shocked me.",5,4,First of His Name
Do you think I'm easily shocked?,5,4,First of His Name
No.,5,4,First of His Name
The things he did shocked me.,5,4,First of His Name
He's only a boy.,5,4,First of His Name
A good boy.,5,4,First of His Name
A decent boy.,5,4,First of His Name
He always has been.,5,4,First of His Name
"Who was the lastdecent king, I wonder?",5,4,First of His Name
He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.,5,4,First of His Name
"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?",5,4,First of His Name
For all the horror that put him there.,5,4,First of His Name
He will need help...,5,4,First of His Name
if he's going to rule well.,5,4,First of His Name
He has you.,5,4,First of His Name
A mother is not enough.,5,4,First of His Name
"You're still interested in being queen, I take it?",5,4,First of His Name
Oh.,5,4,First of His Name
"After all that's happened-- it sounds strange, I know, but I am--",5,4,First of His Name
"I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next.",5,4,First of His Name
"It would be a great honor, of course.",5,4,First of His Name
But I will have to speak to my father about it.,5,4,First of His Name
"Yes, speak to your father.",5,4,First of His Name
I'll speak to mine.,5,4,First of His Name
We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.,5,4,First of His Name
(chuckles),5,4,First of His Name
I won't even know what to call you.,5,4,First of His Name
Sister?,5,4,First of His Name
Or Mother?,5,4,First of His Name
Hmm.,5,4,First of His Name
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.,5,4,First of His Name
Murdered at his own wedding.,5,4,First of His Name
"Barristan: And we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.",5,4,First of His Name
The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.,5,4,First of His Name
Who told you to take the navy?,5,4,First of His Name
No one.,5,4,First of His Name
So why did you do it?,5,4,First of His Name
I heard you liked ships.,5,4,First of His Name
How many ships?,5,4,First of His Name
"93 , Your Grace.",5,4,First of His Name
How many men can they carry?,5,4,First of His Name
"93,000, not counting sailors.",5,4,First of His Name
Would that be enough to take King's Landing?,5,4,First of His Name
The Lannisters have more.,5,4,First of His Name
Barristan: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.,5,4,First of His Name
"They're tired, dispersed.",5,4,First of His Name
And now their king is dead.,5,4,First of His Name
"8,000 Unsullied,",5,4,First of His Name
"2,000 Second Sons",5,4,First of His Name
sailing into Blackwater Bayand storming the gateswithout warning.,5,4,First of His Name
It's hard to say.,5,4,First of His Name
It could be enough.,5,4,First of His Name
But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.,5,4,First of His Name
"10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.",5,4,First of His Name
The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.,5,4,First of His Name
"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.",5,4,First of His Name
There's other news.,5,4,First of His Name
From Yunkai.,5,4,First of His Name
"Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.",5,4,First of His Name
They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.,5,4,First of His Name
"And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty.""",5,4,First of His Name
Please leave me.,5,4,First of His Name
"Not you, Jorah.",5,4,First of His Name
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.,5,4,First of His Name
You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind.,5,4,First of His Name
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.,5,4,First of His Name
A boy many believe to be a b*st*rd with no right to it.,5,4,First of His Name
They've never been more vulnerable.,5,4,First of His Name
You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.,5,4,First of His Name
I didn't listen.,5,4,First of His Name
That all worked out well.,5,4,First of His Name
(chuckles),5,4,First of His Name
How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay?,5,4,First of His Name
Why should anyone trust me?,5,4,First of His Name
Why should anyone follow me?,5,4,First of His Name
You're a Targaryen.,5,4,First of His Name
You're the Mother of Dragons.,5,4,First of His Name
I need to be more than that.,5,4,First of His Name
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.,5,4,First of His Name
I will not sail for Westeros.,5,4,First of His Name
"What, then?",5,4,First of His Name
I will do what queens do.,5,4,First of His Name
I will rule.,5,4,First of His Name
Pull up your hood.,5,4,First of His Name
A memorable shade.,5,4,First of His Name
But how would they know?,5,4,First of His Name
You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?,5,4,First of His Name
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.,5,4,First of His Name
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?,5,4,First of His Name
The mountains are impassable.,5,4,First of His Name
"If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.",5,4,First of His Name
"It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats.",5,4,First of His Name
"The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.",5,4,First of His Name
And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.,5,4,First of His Name
"Not once in 1,000 years.",5,4,First of His Name
"Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.",5,4,First of His Name
Knight: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?,5,4,First of His Name
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.,5,4,First of His Name
Stand to.,5,4,First of His Name
Stand to!,5,4,First of His Name
Stand to!,5,4,First of His Name
"Welcome back, Lord Baelish.",5,4,First of His Name
(gate clanking),5,4,First of His Name
(door opens),5,4,First of His Name
Uncle Petyr!,5,4,First of His Name
Littlefinger:My lord.,5,4,First of His Name
Oh.,5,4,First of His Name
I have brought you a gift.,5,4,First of His Name
Lord Baelish.,5,4,First of His Name
My lady.,5,4,First of His Name
Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.,5,4,First of His Name
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.,5,4,First of His Name
"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.",5,4,First of His Name
My name is Al--,5,4,First of His Name
"Oh, do take down that hood, child.",5,4,First of His Name
Don't you think I know who you are?,5,4,First of His Name
You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was?,5,4,First of His Name
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.,5,4,First of His Name
My flesh and blood.,5,4,First of His Name
"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.",5,4,First of His Name
You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.,5,4,First of His Name
Of course.,5,4,First of His Name
I understand.,5,4,First of His Name
No one can know you're here.,5,4,First of His Name
It would put us in a very precarious position.,5,4,First of His Name
I would never say a thing.,5,4,First of His Name
The Lannisters want to destroy us.,5,4,First of His Name
They've been trying for years.,5,4,First of His Name
Now they knowwhat it feels like.,5,4,First of His Name
Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.,5,4,First of His Name
"They did, and my father's.",5,4,First of His Name
"They killed my father, too, with poison.",5,4,First of His Name
"I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.",5,4,First of His Name
Make him fly?,5,4,First of His Name
Through the Moon Door.,5,4,First of His Name
(giggles),5,4,First of His Name
"Lysa: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.",5,4,First of His Name
They did.,5,4,First of His Name
They made us both.,5,4,First of His Name
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.,5,4,First of His Name
Lysa: I don't believe that for a moment.,5,4,First of His Name
Did he force himself on you?,5,4,First of His Name
No.,5,4,First of His Name
We never--,5,4,First of His Name
Lysa: Good.,5,4,First of His Name
"Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.",5,4,First of His Name
But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself.,5,4,First of His Name
Do you understand?,5,4,First of His Name
"Sansa, this is my son Robin.",5,4,First of His Name
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.",5,4,First of His Name
"Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.",5,4,First of His Name
Take the back stairs.,5,4,First of His Name
Go.,5,4,First of His Name
We'll speak soon.,5,4,First of His Name
What took you so long?,5,4,First of His Name
"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.",5,4,First of His Name
She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.,5,4,First of His Name
Let's get married tonight.,5,4,First of His Name
Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?,5,4,First of His Name
There's only one Lord of the Vale.,5,4,First of His Name
The others can all hang.,5,4,First of His Name
"Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.",5,4,First of His Name
I do think that we could wait until--,5,4,First of His Name
"I'm done waiting, Petyr.",5,4,First of His Name
We had our wedding night many years ago.,5,4,First of His Name
Or don't you remember?,5,4,First of His Name
Like it was yesterday.,5,4,First of His Name
What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?,5,4,First of His Name
What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?,5,4,First of His Name
"When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine-- when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters--",5,4,First of His Name
(moans),5,4,First of His Name
The deed is done.,5,4,First of His Name
Faded into nothing.,5,4,First of His Name
Only speaking of it can make it real.,5,4,First of His Name
"Tonight it is, then.",5,4,First of His Name
(laughs),5,4,First of His Name
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.,5,4,First of His Name
"Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.",5,4,First of His Name
I'm warning you.,5,4,First of His Name
I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.,5,4,First of His Name
"I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.",5,4,First of His Name
(Lysa screaming),5,4,First of His Name
"(grunting, moaning)",5,4,First of His Name
(screaming),5,4,First of His Name
"(moaning, screaming continues)",5,4,First of His Name
When will the wedding take place in your mind?,5,4,First of His Name
As soon as decency permits.,5,4,First of His Name
After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.,5,4,First of His Name
A fortnight?,5,4,First of His Name
That seems reasonable.,5,4,First of His Name
"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.",5,4,First of His Name
And your wedding to Loras?,5,4,First of His Name
Shortly after Tommen's.,5,4,First of His Name
Shortly?,5,4,First of His Name
A fortnight.,5,4,First of His Name
I know you don't like them.,5,4,First of His Name
I didn't like your husband.,5,4,First of His Name
Used to pat me on the back a lot.,5,4,First of His Name
I didn't trust him.,5,4,First of His Name
We had that in common.,5,4,First of His Name
You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.,5,4,First of His Name
Then whom can we trust?,5,4,First of His Name
Ourselves alone.,5,4,First of His Name
The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.,5,4,First of His Name
Robert wasn't particularly rich.,5,4,First of His Name
Robert had me funding him.,5,4,First of His Name
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.,5,4,First of His Name
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.,5,4,First of His Name
Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?,5,4,First of His Name
Haven't a clue.,5,4,First of His Name
"Go on, your best guess.",5,4,First of His Name
"Pounds, tons, ounces?",5,4,First of His Name
Doesn't matter.,5,4,First of His Name
The answer is the same.,5,4,First of His Name
That can't be.,5,4,First of His Name
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.,5,4,First of His Name
Then how do we pay for anything?,5,4,First of His Name
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.,5,4,First of His Name
How much?,5,4,First of His Name
A tremendous amount.,5,4,First of His Name
"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.",5,4,First of His Name
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.,5,4,First of His Name
There is no someone.,5,4,First of His Name
Someone does work there.,5,4,First of His Name
It is comprised of people.,5,4,First of His Name
And a temple is comprised of stones.,5,4,First of His Name
One stone crumbles and another takes its place.,5,4,First of His Name
"And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more.",5,4,First of His Name
That's what the Iron Bank is-- a temple.,5,4,First of His Name
We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.,5,4,First of His Name
You can't run from them.,5,4,First of His Name
You can't cheat them.,5,4,First of His Name
You can't sway them with excuses.,5,4,First of His Name
"If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.",5,4,First of His Name
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.,5,4,First of His Name
"It's for the good of the family, I understand that.",5,4,First of His Name
I'm not sure my brothers do.,5,4,First of His Name
I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.,5,4,First of His Name
"And as a mother,that is your right.",5,4,First of His Name
"But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.",5,4,First of His Name
I respect that.,5,4,First of His Name
We don't need to discuss it.,5,4,First of His Name
The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.,5,4,First of His Name
You've started wars to protect this family.,5,4,First of His Name
Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.,5,4,First of His Name
What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?,5,4,First of His Name
Arya:Joffrey.,5,4,First of His Name
Cersei.,5,4,First of His Name
Walder Frey.,5,4,First of His Name
Meryn Trant.,5,4,First of His Name
Tywin Lannister.,5,4,First of His Name
The Red Woman.,5,4,First of His Name
Beric Dondarrion.,5,4,First of His Name
Thoros of Myr.,5,4,First of His Name
Ilyn Payne.,5,4,First of His Name
The Mountain.,5,4,First of His Name
Would you shut up?,5,4,First of His Name
I can't sleep until I say the names.,5,4,First of His Name
The names of every f*cking person in Westeros?,5,4,First of His Name
Only the ones I'm going to kill.,5,4,First of His Name
(chuckles),5,4,First of His Name
Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.,5,4,First of His Name
Better than most.,5,4,First of His Name
"We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.",5,4,First of His Name
"If he were here right now, what would you do?",5,4,First of His Name
I'd tell him to shut the f*ck up so I can get some sleep.,5,4,First of His Name
"Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.",5,4,First of His Name
I'm almost done.,5,4,First of His Name
Only one name left.,5,4,First of His Name
Go on.,5,4,First of His Name
The Hound.,5,4,First of His Name
Thank you.,5,4,First of His Name
"Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?",5,4,First of His Name
Really?,5,4,First of His Name
"Oh, yes.",5,4,First of His Name
"At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard.",5,4,First of His Name
Anything sweet.,5,4,First of His Name
"Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.",5,4,First of His Name
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.,5,4,First of His Name
It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.,5,4,First of His Name
My mother fat?,5,4,First of His Name
She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.,5,4,First of His Name
This is before she married your father and moved to the North.,5,4,First of His Name
"By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.",5,4,First of His Name
Marriage changes people.,5,4,First of His Name
I didn't mean for you to stop.,5,4,First of His Name
"Go on, enjoy them.",5,4,First of His Name
How do you like them?,5,4,First of His Name
They're delicious.,5,4,First of His Name
Where did you get the lemons?,5,4,First of His Name
You can't grow them up here.,5,4,First of His Name
"Oh, gods, no.",5,4,First of His Name
Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.,5,4,First of His Name
He knew you liked lemon cakes.,5,4,First of His Name
He's so kind.,5,4,First of His Name
He really cares for you.,5,4,First of His Name
Think where you'd be without him.,5,4,First of His Name
In their clutches and tried for murder.,5,4,First of His Name
Yes.,5,4,First of His Name
I'm very lucky.,5,4,First of His Name
He feels responsible for you.,5,4,First of His Name
"Oh, I know he does.",5,4,First of His Name
I'm so grateful.,5,4,First of His Name
Why?,5,4,First of His Name
Why does he feel responsible for you?,5,4,First of His Name
"Well, I'm half Tully.",5,4,First of His Name
He loved your family so much.,5,4,First of His Name
Loved your mother.,5,4,First of His Name
No.,5,4,First of His Name
That's what you wanted to say.,5,4,First of His Name
"He loves you, Aunt Lysa.",5,4,First of His Name
He's married to you.,5,4,First of His Name
Your mother never loved him. Never.,5,4,First of His Name
Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.,5,4,First of His Name
The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.,5,4,First of His Name
"Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.",5,4,First of His Name
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.,5,4,First of His Name
And your mother loved him anyway.,5,4,First of His Name
"And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels.",5,4,First of His Name
Has he told you about them?,5,4,First of His Name
No.,5,4,First of His Name
He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies?,5,4,First of His Name
The vile things they let him do with their bodies?,5,4,First of His Name
" No, never.",5,4,First of His Name
Are you pregnant?,5,4,First of His Name
"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never--",5,4,First of His Name
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.,5,4,First of His Name
What have you let Petyr do with your body?,5,4,First of His Name
"Aunt Lysa, no, I--",5,4,First of His Name
"Your young, pretty body.",5,4,First of His Name
Nothing. I'm a virgin.,5,4,First of His Name
Don't lie to me.,5,4,First of His Name
You're hurting me.,5,4,First of His Name
I'll know if you lie.,5,4,First of His Name
"I'm a virgin, I swear it.",5,4,First of His Name
"He loves you, Aunt Lysa.",5,4,First of His Name
All he says is that I'm stupid.,5,4,First of His Name
"I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth.",5,4,First of His Name
And I swear to you that he has never touched me.,5,4,First of His Name
"Not once, not ever.",5,4,First of His Name
Shh. Shh. Shh.,5,4,First of His Name
It's all right.,5,4,First of His Name
It will all be all right.,5,4,First of His Name
You'll be a widow soon.,5,4,First of His Name
They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin.,5,4,First of His Name
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.,5,4,First of His Name
Hmm.,5,4,First of His Name
(horse whinnies),5,4,First of His Name
(grunting),5,4,First of His Name
Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?,5,4,First of His Name
"Yes, my lady, when I was young.",5,4,First of His Name
"There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though.",5,4,First of His Name
He preferred litters.,5,4,First of His Name
Perhaps you should have stayed with him.,5,4,First of His Name
It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you.,5,4,First of His Name
"It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.",5,4,First of His Name
That's a long way off.,5,4,First of His Name
"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black.",5,4,First of His Name
"If I were her, that's where I'd go.",5,4,First of His Name
Feel free to stop at any point.,5,4,First of His Name
"Never, my lady. I'm your squire.",5,4,First of His Name
I've made it this far in the world without a squire.,5,4,First of His Name
I don't see why I need one now.,5,4,First of His Name
"All knights have squires, my lady.",5,4,First of His Name
I'm not a knight.,5,4,First of His Name
"And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.",5,4,First of His Name
"I swore an oath, my lady.",5,4,First of His Name
I am releasing you from that oath.,5,4,First of His Name
That means you could leave.,5,4,First of His Name
I know.,5,4,First of His Name
What do you think will happen if you leave?,5,4,First of His Name
They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.,5,4,First of His Name

No one's going to kill me.,5,4,First of His Name
They will if you nance around like that.,5,4,First of His Name
That's no way to fight.,5,4,First of His Name
It's not fighting.,5,4,First of His Name
It's water dancing.,5,4,First of His Name
Dancing?,5,4,First of His Name
Maybe you ought to put on a dress.,5,4,First of His Name
Who taught you that shite?,5,4,First of His Name
The greatest swordsman who ever lived.,5,4,First of His Name

I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's c**t.,5,4,First of His Name
It was not.,5,4,First of His Name

Yes.,5,4,First of His Name

Yes.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
After we received word of Robb Stark's death.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men

(crowd murmuring),6,4,The Laws of God and Men
"You're excused, Lord Varys.",6,4,The Laws of God and Men

This isn't a trial.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
It's a farce.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
I know nothing of the sort.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men

Father's agreed to it.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both knowhow that turned out.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men

Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
You admit you poisoned the king?,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
"No, of that I'm innocent.",6,4,The Laws of God and Men
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
I am guilty of being a dwarf.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men
"Tyrion:Oh, yes, I am.",6,4,The Laws of God and Men
I've been on trial for that my entire life.,6,4,The Laws of God and Men

I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.,7,4,Mockingbird
" I'm sorry,what am I grateful for?",7,4,Mockingbird
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?,7,4,Mockingbird
You threw your life away. You threw it away.,7,4,Mockingbird
"It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?",7,4,Mockingbird
"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one.",7,4,Mockingbird
I couldn't-- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies.,7,4,Mockingbird
I couldn't do it.,7,4,Mockingbird
You fell in love with a whore.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, I fell in love with a whore.",7,4,Mockingbird
And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.,7,4,Mockingbird
"That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted.",7,4,Mockingbird
You do see that?,7,4,Mockingbird
He gets you back as his heir.,7,4,Mockingbird
The future Lord of the Rock.,7,4,Mockingbird
"And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last.",7,4,Mockingbird
All so perfect.,7,4,Mockingbird
It felt good to take that from him.,7,4,Mockingbird
He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.,7,4,Mockingbird
He's willing to sacrifice any of us.,7,4,Mockingbird
Not you.,7,4,Mockingbird
You're the golden son.,7,4,Mockingbird
"You could kill a king, lose a hand, f*ck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.",7,4,Mockingbird
Careful.,7,4,Mockingbird
I'm the last friend you've got.,7,4,Mockingbird
At least I got to tell them what they really are.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, brilliant speech.",7,4,Mockingbird
They'll be talking about it for days to come.,7,4,Mockingbird
I thought you were a realist.,7,4,Mockingbird
Didn't realize you'd die for pride.,7,4,Mockingbird
Don't give up on me just yet.,7,4,Mockingbird
"I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.",7,4,Mockingbird
I can't save you this time either.,7,4,Mockingbird
My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.,7,4,Mockingbird
Where's your sense of adventure?,7,4,Mockingbird
"Even if you lose, imagine the look",7,4,Mockingbird
on Father's face when you fall.,7,4,Mockingbird
Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.,7,4,Mockingbird
It is tempting.,7,4,Mockingbird
Well...,7,4,Mockingbird
"Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again.",7,4,Mockingbird
"If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.",7,4,Mockingbird
If he wins.,7,4,Mockingbird
Will you find him for me?,7,4,Mockingbird
Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion?,7,4,Mockingbird
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.,7,4,Mockingbird
I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.,7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird
Not Ser Meryn.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Go on, move it.",7,4,Mockingbird
And you.,7,4,Mockingbird
Come on.,7,4,Mockingbird
Mercy.,7,4,Mockingbird
Please.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Please, mercy.",7,4,Mockingbird
Ser Gregor.,7,4,Mockingbird
Welcome to the capital.,7,4,Mockingbird
Thank you for riding here so quickly.,7,4,Mockingbird
You seem to be in good form.,7,4,Mockingbird
Who am I fighting?,7,4,Mockingbird
Does it matter?,7,4,Mockingbird
Could be food.,7,4,Mockingbird
Could be soldiers.,7,4,Mockingbird
You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.,7,4,Mockingbird
Where else to sit?,7,4,Mockingbird
"Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much.",7,4,Mockingbird
Then I remembered they burned my hut down.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Who were ""they""?",7,4,Mockingbird
I stopped asking a while ago.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's not gonna get better.,7,4,Mockingbird
Doesn't seem so.,7,4,Mockingbird
A bad way to go.,7,4,Mockingbird
Haven't you had enough?,7,4,Mockingbird
Of what?,7,4,Mockingbird
I know.,7,4,Mockingbird
Time to go.,7,4,Mockingbird
Take matters into my own hands.,7,4,Mockingbird
The thought has occurred to me.,7,4,Mockingbird
So why go on?,7,4,Mockingbird
Habit.,7,4,Mockingbird
Nothing could be worse than this.,7,4,Mockingbird
Maybe nothing is worse than this.,7,4,Mockingbird
Nothing isn't better or worse than anything.,7,4,Mockingbird
Nothing is just nothing.,7,4,Mockingbird
Who are you?,7,4,Mockingbird
My name is Arya.,7,4,Mockingbird
Arya Stark.,7,4,Mockingbird
You her father?,7,4,Mockingbird
Her captor.,7,4,Mockingbird
Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.,7,4,Mockingbird
"A fair exchange, that is.",7,4,Mockingbird
Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings.,7,4,Mockingbird
"You give me, I give you.",7,4,Mockingbird
Fair.,7,4,Mockingbird
A balance.,7,4,Mockingbird
No balance anymore.,7,4,Mockingbird
Could I have a drink?,7,4,Mockingbird
Dying is thirsty work.,7,4,Mockingbird
Wish it were wine.,7,4,Mockingbird
So do I.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's where the heart is.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's how you kill a man.,7,4,Mockingbird
The f*ck you doing?,7,4,Mockingbird
There's a price on your head.,7,4,Mockingbird
Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to f*ck off.,7,4,Mockingbird
The king's dead.,7,4,Mockingbird
He drank poisoned wineat his own wedding.,7,4,Mockingbird
The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.,7,4,Mockingbird
100 silver stags.,7,4,Mockingbird
And you thought you were going to collect it?,7,4,Mockingbird
"Didn't think very hard, did you?",7,4,Mockingbird
You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.,7,4,Mockingbird
He told me he'd f*ck me bloody with a stick.,7,4,Mockingbird
This day's really not working out the way you planned.,7,4,Mockingbird
He on your little list?,7,4,Mockingbird
He can't be.,7,4,Mockingbird
I don't know his name.,7,4,Mockingbird
What's your name?,7,4,Mockingbird
Rorge.,7,4,Mockingbird
Thank you.,7,4,Mockingbird
You're learning.,7,4,Mockingbird
 Rangers returning!,7,4,Mockingbird
They return!,7,4,Mockingbird
 Rangers returning!,7,4,Mockingbird
Greetings.,7,4,Mockingbird
Didn't think I'd see you again.,7,4,Mockingbird
"All right, Jon?",7,4,Mockingbird
"Welcome back, brother.",7,4,Mockingbird
Lord Snow.,7,4,Mockingbird
This is no place for wild beasts.,7,4,Mockingbird
Lock him away,7,4,Mockingbird
or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Come on, Ghost.",7,4,Mockingbird
Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left.,7,4,Mockingbird
We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.,7,4,Mockingbird
They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.,7,4,Mockingbird
I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello.,7,4,Mockingbird
"The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?",7,4,Mockingbird
We need to prepare.,7,4,Mockingbird
We've been preparing.,7,4,Mockingbird
We should seal the tunnel.,7,4,Mockingbird
Plug it with rocks and ice.,7,4,Mockingbird
Flood it and let it freeze.,7,4,Mockingbird
And how would we range north?,7,4,Mockingbird
We wouldn't.,7,4,Mockingbird
- Coward.,7,4,Mockingbird
"You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?",7,4,Mockingbird
"We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men.",7,4,Mockingbird
This castle has stood for thousands of years.,7,4,Mockingbird
The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years.,7,4,Mockingbird
"And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?",7,4,Mockingbird
I have.,7,4,Mockingbird
The tunnel's gate won't stop them.,7,4,Mockingbird
The bars on those gates are four inches thick.,7,4,Mockingbird
Cold-rolled steel.,7,4,Mockingbird
And they won't stop them.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.",7,4,Mockingbird
The stewards.,7,4,Mockingbird
Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?,7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird
Who would that be?,7,4,Mockingbird
The builders.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Ah, the builders.",7,4,Mockingbird
"First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.",7,4,Mockingbird
Do you agree with him?,7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.",7,4,Mockingbird
Moving on.,7,4,Mockingbird
"First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.",7,4,Mockingbird
Aye.,7,4,Mockingbird
My lord.,7,4,Mockingbird
You have new clothes.,7,4,Mockingbird
Do you like 'em?,7,4,Mockingbird
Eh?,7,4,Mockingbird
Gloves are doeskin.,7,4,Mockingbird
Softer than a virgin's thighs.,7,4,Mockingbird
I sent for you days ago.,7,4,Mockingbird
I've been a bit busy.,7,4,Mockingbird
Doing what?,7,4,Mockingbird
My lonesome bachelor days are over.,7,4,Mockingbird
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.,7,4,Mockingbird
Lollys Stokeworth?,7,4,Mockingbird
She doesn't strike meas your sort of girl.,7,4,Mockingbird
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.,7,4,Mockingbird
She's dim-witted.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.",7,4,Mockingbird
"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?",7,4,Mockingbird
Falyse.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Aye, I did know about the older sister.",7,4,Mockingbird
And you understand the rules of inheritance?,7,4,Mockingbird
Falyse is 40 and barren.,7,4,Mockingbird
She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.,7,4,Mockingbird
She does.,7,4,Mockingbird
Unless she happens to perish before her father.,7,4,Mockingbird
Then Lollys gets the castle.,7,4,Mockingbird
What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.,7,4,Mockingbird
You and my sister deserve each other.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why did you bother to come here?,7,4,Mockingbird
"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.",7,4,Mockingbird
Is it two wives you want or two castles?,7,4,Mockingbird
One of each will do.,7,4,Mockingbird
"But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.",7,4,Mockingbird
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.,7,4,Mockingbird
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.,7,4,Mockingbird
I have gold.,7,4,Mockingbird
What can I buy with gratitude?,7,4,Mockingbird
You might be surprised.,7,4,Mockingbird
A Lannister always pays his debts.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Your sister's a Lannister, too.",7,4,Mockingbird
My wife is heir to Winterfell.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rulethe North in her name.",7,4,Mockingbird
I could carve you out a big piece of it.,7,4,Mockingbird
If and may and could.,7,4,Mockingbird
It's bloody cold up north.,7,4,Mockingbird
Lollys is soft and warm.,7,4,Mockingbird
And close.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If I gave you the choice between f*cking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.",7,4,Mockingbird
Does he frighten you so much?,7,4,Mockingbird
I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.,7,4,Mockingbird
He's freakish big and freakish strong.,7,4,Mockingbird
And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow.",7,4,Mockingbird
But one misstep...,7,4,Mockingbird
...and I'm dead.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why should I risk it?,7,4,Mockingbird
Because you're my friend.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Aye, I'm your friend.",7,4,Mockingbird
And when have you ever risked your life for me?,7,4,Mockingbird
"I like you, pampered little sh1t that you are.",7,4,Mockingbird
I just like myself more.,7,4,Mockingbird
I understand.,7,4,Mockingbird
I'm sorry it has to be this way.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why are you sorry?,7,4,Mockingbird
Because you're an evil b*st*rd with no conscience and no heart?,7,4,Mockingbird
That's what I liked aboutyou in the first place.,7,4,Mockingbird
We had some good days together.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, we did.",7,4,Mockingbird
What will you do?,7,4,Mockingbird
I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.,7,4,Mockingbird
Won't that make for a great song?,7,4,Mockingbird
I hope to hear them sing it one day.,7,4,Mockingbird
How did you get in here?,7,4,Mockingbird
"Your door is well guarded, but your window is not.",7,4,Mockingbird
I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.,7,4,Mockingbird
Don't do that again.,7,4,Mockingbird
Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.,7,4,Mockingbird
These are my private quarters.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If I want you here, I will summon you.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.",7,4,Mockingbird
Tell me why you're here.,7,4,Mockingbird
I came to ask a favor.,7,4,Mockingbird
I only have two talents in this world-- war and women.,7,4,Mockingbird
You are staying herein Meereen to rule.,7,4,Mockingbird
That is a wise decision.I respect it.,7,4,Mockingbird
"But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.",7,4,Mockingbird
I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.,7,4,Mockingbird
You've ordered us to be night watchmen.,7,4,Mockingbird
"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.",7,4,Mockingbird
"There is only one, and she does not want me.",7,4,Mockingbird
You swore me your sword.,7,4,Mockingbird
My sword is yours till the day I die.,7,4,Mockingbird
So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?,7,4,Mockingbird
I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.,7,4,Mockingbird
Send me to kill your enemies.,7,4,Mockingbird
Any enemy anywhere.,7,4,Mockingbird
Let me do what I do best.,7,4,Mockingbird
Very well.,7,4,Mockingbird
Do what you do best.,7,4,Mockingbird
Take off your clothes.,7,4,Mockingbird
Oh.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Come in, my queen.",7,4,Mockingbird
Please.,7,4,Mockingbird
"I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
You could never disturb me.,7,4,Mockingbird
I just wanted to speak with you before we left.,7,4,Mockingbird
Could you bring me that vial over there?,7,4,Mockingbird
The blue one.,7,4,Mockingbird
"No, no, no.",7,4,Mockingbird
Not that one.,7,4,Mockingbird
You don't even want to touch that one.,7,4,Mockingbird
Next to it.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's the one.,7,4,Mockingbird
"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me.",7,4,Mockingbird
"He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count.""",7,4,Mockingbird
A joke.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Not a very good one, I'm afraid.",7,4,Mockingbird
It was. I-- humor isn't my strength.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?",7,4,Mockingbird
Not always.,7,4,Mockingbird
Most of these powders and potions are lies.,7,4,Mockingbird
Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth.",7,4,Mockingbird
A pinch of this powderin a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.,7,4,Mockingbird
And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.,7,4,Mockingbird
And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.,7,4,Mockingbird
Did you use it with Stannis?,7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird

Don't be upset.,7,4,Mockingbird
Men never crave what they already have.,7,4,Mockingbird
It's only flesh.,7,4,Mockingbird
It needs what it needs.,7,4,Mockingbird
No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin.,7,4,Mockingbird
I thank God every day for bringing you to us.,7,4,Mockingbird
And Stannis to you.,7,4,Mockingbird
He wants to bring Shireen with us.,7,4,Mockingbird
I think that would be ill-advised.,7,4,Mockingbird
"My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware.",7,4,Mockingbird
"I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.",7,4,Mockingbird
I understand how you feel.,7,4,Mockingbird
Hmm.,7,4,Mockingbird
But that is impossible.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why?,7,4,Mockingbird
"You don't need powders and potions, my queen.",7,4,Mockingbird
You don't need lies.,7,4,Mockingbird
You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.,7,4,Mockingbird
However harsh it is.,7,4,Mockingbird
However hard for us to understand.,7,4,Mockingbird
"You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon.",7,4,Mockingbird
"When we set sail, your daughter must be with us.",7,4,Mockingbird
The Lord needs her.,7,4,Mockingbird
Jorah the Andal.,7,4,Mockingbird
Are you here to see our queen?,7,4,Mockingbird
She's in a good mood.,7,4,Mockingbird
Khaleesi.,7,4,Mockingbird
You're here early.,7,4,Mockingbird
Later than some.,7,4,Mockingbird
You don't approve?,7,4,Mockingbird
"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.",7,4,Mockingbird
You neither approve nor trust.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why would I?,7,4,Mockingbird
The man's a sellsword.,7,4,Mockingbird
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?,7,4,Mockingbird
I did.,7,4,Mockingbird
I trust you.,7,4,Mockingbird
Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.,7,4,Mockingbird
How could you ever have faith in a man like that?,7,4,Mockingbird
I could never have faith in a man like Daario.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.,7,4,Mockingbird
You have?,7,4,Mockingbird
I have.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.",7,4,Mockingbird
That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.,7,4,Mockingbird
The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms.,7,4,Mockingbird
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.,7,4,Mockingbird
They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.,7,4,Mockingbird
"They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.",7,4,Mockingbird
Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts.,7,4,Mockingbird
"The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known.",7,4,Mockingbird
"If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.",7,4,Mockingbird
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?,7,4,Mockingbird
A fine?,7,4,Mockingbird
A stern warning?,7,4,Mockingbird
"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.",7,4,Mockingbird
Let the priests argue over good and evil.,7,4,Mockingbird
Slavery is real.,7,4,Mockingbird
I can end it.,7,4,Mockingbird
I will end it.,7,4,Mockingbird
And I will end those behind it.,7,4,Mockingbird
"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.",7,4,Mockingbird
And now you are helping me show them to freedom.,7,4,Mockingbird
I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.,7,4,Mockingbird
The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.,7,4,Mockingbird
Hizdahr zo Loraq?,7,4,Mockingbird
He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.,7,4,Mockingbird
He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.,7,4,Mockingbird
He will explain the choice they have before them.,7,4,Mockingbird
They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.",7,4,Mockingbird
Tell him I changed my mind.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, Khaleesi.",7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird
Tell him you changed my mind.,7,4,Mockingbird
Rat c**ts.,7,4,Mockingbird
f*cking whore.,7,4,Mockingbird
You're doing it wrong.,7,4,Mockingbird
You need to burn away that horrible bit there.,7,4,Mockingbird
Otherwise it's gonnaget infected and fester.,7,4,Mockingbird
"I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right--",7,4,Mockingbird
No fire.,7,4,Mockingbird
It'll only take a second.,7,4,Mockingbird
It won't hurt that much.,7,4,Mockingbird
No fire!,7,4,Mockingbird
Shut up about it.,7,4,Mockingbird
Shut up about everything.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.",7,4,Mockingbird
Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.,7,4,Mockingbird
"I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.",7,4,Mockingbird
No reward is worth this much trouble.,7,4,Mockingbird
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.,7,4,Mockingbird
You say your brother gave you that sword.,7,4,Mockingbird
My brother gave me this.,7,4,Mockingbird
It was just like you said a while back.,7,4,Mockingbird
Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why?,7,4,Mockingbird
Thought I stole one of his toys.,7,4,Mockingbird
I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it.,7,4,Mockingbird
The pain was bad.,7,4,Mockingbird
The smell was worse.,7,4,Mockingbird
But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.,7,4,Mockingbird
"My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire.",7,4,Mockingbird
You think you're on your own?,7,4,Mockingbird
Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.,7,4,Mockingbird
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.,7,4,Mockingbird
We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.,7,4,Mockingbird
I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Couldn't agree more, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.,7,4,Mockingbird
Not working for your former lord any longer.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
Don't get drunk.,7,4,Mockingbird
"No, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
Can I get you anything else?,7,4,Mockingbird
"No, this will do nicely, thank you.",7,4,Mockingbird
Kidney pie is wonderful.,7,4,Mockingbird
Thanks.,7,4,Mockingbird
I do my best.,7,4,Mockingbird
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.",7,4,Mockingbird
Easy enough.,7,4,Mockingbird
"But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy.",7,4,Mockingbird
"I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Got no right to cook anything, them.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Oh, and the gravy.",7,4,Mockingbird
Don't get me started on the gravy.,7,4,Mockingbird
Very difficult to get right.,7,4,Mockingbird
"See, a lot of peoplegive up on the gravy.",7,4,Mockingbird
You cannot give up on the gravy.,7,4,Mockingbird
"No gravy, no pie.",7,4,Mockingbird
Simple as that.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's nice armor.,7,4,Mockingbird
Are you a knight?,7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you?",7,4,Mockingbird
From there myself originally.Flea Bottom born and bred.,7,4,Mockingbird
What brings you to these parts?,7,4,Mockingbird
We're looking for someone.,7,4,Mockingbird
Someone in particular?,7,4,Mockingbird
Maybe they came in here.,7,4,Mockingbird
A lot of people come in here.,7,4,Mockingbird
Just the other day we had --,7,4,Mockingbird
"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.",7,4,Mockingbird
Starks?,7,4,Mockingbird
"What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?",7,4,Mockingbird
"No, ain't seen anyone like that.",7,4,Mockingbird
I heard they was all traitors.,7,4,Mockingbird
Don't need no traitors in here.,7,4,Mockingbird
I pledged my life totheir mother Catelyn Stark.,7,4,Mockingbird
I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.,7,4,Mockingbird
Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?,7,4,Mockingbird
What?,7,4,Mockingbird
"It's nothing, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Don't want to offend, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Truly, I don't.",7,4,Mockingbird
You're not interesting enough to be offensive.,7,4,Mockingbird
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.,7,4,Mockingbird
The Lannisters have money.,7,4,Mockingbird
People kill for money.,7,4,Mockingbird
I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.,7,4,Mockingbird
My lady. My lord.,7,4,Mockingbird
Could I have a word?,7,4,Mockingbird
What about? Not kidney pie.,7,4,Mockingbird
You seem like a proper lady.,7,4,Mockingbird
Someone who could be trusted.,7,4,Mockingbird
I never met no Sansa Stark.,7,4,Mockingbird
But I know her sister...,7,4,Mockingbird
Arya.,7,4,Mockingbird
No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.,7,4,Mockingbird
She's presumed dead.,7,4,Mockingbird
She weren't when I last spoke to her.,7,4,Mockingbird
When was that? - Heading up north withthe Night's Watch.,7,4,Mockingbird
She was all dressed up as a boy.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Like your ladyship, only without the armor.",7,4,Mockingbird
Going by the name Arry.,7,4,Mockingbird
So what happened to her?,7,4,Mockingbird
Well--,7,4,Mockingbird
The quick version.,7,4,Mockingbird
The Lannisters took us prisoner.,7,4,Mockingbird
We escaped.,7,4,Mockingbird
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.,7,4,Mockingbird
They sold me to the innkeep.,7,4,Mockingbird
They were gonna sell Aryato her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.,7,4,Mockingbird
Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.,7,4,Mockingbird
 Not friendly.,7,4,Mockingbird
The Hound.,7,4,Mockingbird
That's the one.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If you find her, could you give her this?",7,4,Mockingbird
"She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Um, you were saying?",7,4,Mockingbird
"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.",7,4,Mockingbird
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.,7,4,Mockingbird
"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
Why the Eyrie?,7,4,Mockingbird
"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.",7,4,Mockingbird
Catelyn Stark's sister.,7,4,Mockingbird
She's Arya's last living relative with money.,7,4,Mockingbird
She hates the Lannisters.,7,4,Mockingbird
Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Sansa could be there, too.",7,4,Mockingbird
"Aye, my lady.",7,4,Mockingbird
Could be.,7,4,Mockingbird
You sure about this?,7,4,Mockingbird
No.,7,4,Mockingbird
I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.,7,4,Mockingbird
I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Mm, do tell.",7,4,Mockingbird
I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.,7,4,Mockingbird
Your sister.,7,4,Mockingbird
Oh.,7,4,Mockingbird
Cersei approached me.,7,4,Mockingbird
We spoke a great dealabout her daughter.,7,4,Mockingbird
How worried your sister is about her.,7,4,Mockingbird
She was tryingvery hard to pretend she had not cometo sway me against you.,7,4,Mockingbird
I think she may have evenbelieved it herself.,7,4,Mockingbird
Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,7,4,Mockingbird
It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.,7,4,Mockingbird
It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.,7,4,Mockingbird
She desperately wants to see you killed.,7,4,Mockingbird
She didn't need to bother you.,7,4,Mockingbird
It looks as though I've taken care of that myself.,7,4,Mockingbird
The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck.,7,4,Mockingbird
She's wanted this for a long time.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, I know.",7,4,Mockingbird
"We met, you and I.",7,4,Mockingbird
Many years ago.,7,4,Mockingbird
I think I would have remembered that.,7,4,Mockingbird
Unlikely.,7,4,Mockingbird
You had just been born.,7,4,Mockingbird
Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.,7,4,Mockingbird
My first time away from Dorne.,7,4,Mockingbird
I didn't like anything about the Rock.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Not the food, not the weather, not your accents.",7,4,Mockingbird
Nothing.,7,4,Mockingbird
But the biggest disappointment... you.,7,4,Mockingbird
You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,7,4,Mockingbird
The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister.,7,4,Mockingbird
"A head twicethe size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",7,4,Mockingbird
That would have made things so much easier.,7,4,Mockingbird
"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us.",7,4,Mockingbird
Every day we would ask.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Every day she would say, ""Soon.""",7,4,Mockingbird
Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak.,7,4,Mockingbird
Your head was a bit large.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Your arms and legswere a bit small, but no claw.",7,4,Mockingbird
No red eye.,7,4,Mockingbird
No tail between your legs.,7,4,Mockingbird
Just a tiny pink cock.,7,4,Mockingbird
We didn't try to hideour disappointment.,7,4,Mockingbird
"""That's not a monster,""I told Cersei.",7,4,Mockingbird
"""That's just a baby.""",7,4,Mockingbird
"And she said,""He killed my mother.""",7,4,Mockingbird
"And she pinchedyour little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off.",7,4,Mockingbird
Until your brothermade her stop.,7,4,Mockingbird
"""It doesn't matter,""she told us.",7,4,Mockingbird
"""Everyone says he will die soon.",7,4,Mockingbird
I hope they are right.,7,4,Mockingbird
"He should nothave lived this long.""",7,4,Mockingbird
"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.",7,4,Mockingbird
And what about what I want?,7,4,Mockingbird
Justice for my sister and her children.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.",7,4,Mockingbird
I disagree.,7,4,Mockingbird
I've come to the perfect place.,7,4,Mockingbird
I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.,7,4,Mockingbird
And all those who have wronged me are right here.,7,4,Mockingbird
"I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too.",7,4,Mockingbird
I will be your champion.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Hello, Robin.",7,4,Mockingbird
What are you doing?,7,4,Mockingbird
"I'm building my home, Winterfell.",7,4,Mockingbird
At least I think I am.,7,4,Mockingbird
I haven't been back there in a very long time.,7,4,Mockingbird
Why did you leave?,7,4,Mockingbird
It's a long story.,7,4,Mockingbird
I stay here in the Eyrie.,7,4,Mockingbird
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, you certainly are.",7,4,Mockingbird
When will you go back?,7,4,Mockingbird
Probably never.,7,4,Mockingbird
My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.,7,4,Mockingbird
Oh.,7,4,Mockingbird
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?,7,4,Mockingbird
"No, I'm afraid not.",7,4,Mockingbird
It's not high up in the mountains.,7,4,Mockingbird
It's down on the ground.,7,4,Mockingbird
That sounds dangerous.,7,4,Mockingbird
How do you make people fly?,7,4,Mockingbird
We don't.,7,4,Mockingbird
What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?,7,4,Mockingbird
I never did anything with them at all.,7,4,Mockingbird
Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.",7,4,Mockingbird
"When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.",7,4,Mockingbird
Or you.,7,4,Mockingbird
"When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh!",7,4,Mockingbird
Right through the Moon Door.,7,4,Mockingbird
I like the sound of that.,7,4,Mockingbird
Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.,7,4,Mockingbird
All right.,7,4,Mockingbird
It can go in here in this big tower.,7,4,Mockingbird
Careful.,7,4,Mockingbird
You've ruined it.,7,4,Mockingbird
Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.,7,4,Mockingbird
I didn't ruin it.,7,4,Mockingbird
You did.,7,4,Mockingbird
It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door.,7,4,Mockingbird
I was fixing it.,7,4,Mockingbird
Knocking things down isn't fixing them.,7,4,Mockingbird
It's ruining them.,7,4,Mockingbird
I didn't ruin it!,7,4,Mockingbird
You're being stupid.,7,4,Mockingbird
I didn't ruin it!,7,4,Mockingbird
"Robin, I'm sorry, I-- Children.",7,4,Mockingbird
 I hit him.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Yes, I saw.",7,4,Mockingbird
I shouldn't have done that.,7,4,Mockingbird
"No, his mother should have a long time ago.",7,4,Mockingbird
Consider it a step in the right direction.,7,4,Mockingbird
If he tells Aunt Lysa...,7,4,Mockingbird
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.,7,4,Mockingbird
I was trying to remember what everything looked like.,7,4,Mockingbird
I'll never see it again.,7,4,Mockingbird
A lot can happen between now and never.,7,4,Mockingbird
"If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.",7,4,Mockingbird
Why did you really kill Joffrey?,7,4,Mockingbird
Tell me why.,7,4,Mockingbird
I loved your mother more than you could ever know.,7,4,Mockingbird
"Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love?",7,4,Mockingbird
"In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child.",7,4,Mockingbird
But we don't live in that world.,7,4,Mockingbird
You're more beautiful than she ever was.,7,4,Mockingbird

And what does Lord Bolton want?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"You are fading from sickness, you are badly outnumbered, and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Do this, and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

"Royce: You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Royce:  Our forebearers settled the Valethousands of years ago.We've fought off invadersever since.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

Lady Arryn invited me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She and I have been close since childhood.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Yes, we all know how close you were.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Lady Arryn's predilectionswere her own affair.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Her death is our affair.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She was an odd fish.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Everyone knew that.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
But suicide?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She adored that boy of hers.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

Not by choice.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Royce: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She was always prone to melancholy.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

We were told there was a witness.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
A girl.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"A niece of yours, I believe.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I assure you, she would be of no help.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
We'd like to speak with her.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

Anya: No need.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(door closes),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Come closer, child.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You have nothing to fear from us or him.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Your name is Alayne?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
My lady--,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I wasn't asking you.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"He can stay. - Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Tell us what you saw.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I have to tell the truth.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I'll tell you everything.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Sansa Stark?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

Lord Baelish has told many lies.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
All to protect me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I had no friends in King's Landing... except one.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He saved me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
The Lannisters have friends everywhere.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Even the Vale.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Your secret is safe with us, my lady.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Royce: Your father grew up right here in these halls.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
We hunted together many times.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He was a fine man.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"You knew her well, my lords, my lady.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You knew she was a troubled woman.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She always loved Lord Baelish.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She told me herself.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She confessed to meshe never loved Lord Arryn.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"When the gods finally allowedher to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
For a time.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
My aunt was a jealous lady.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
That he would abandon her for a younger woman.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
And then... one day she saw him kiss me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Lady Sansa.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He's always been so kind to me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I was so happy to be here, to be free.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
All because of him.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
But my aunt turned on me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She cursed me.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Called me a whore.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Promised to throw me through the Moon Door.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She said she didn't want to live anymore.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
She stood on the edgeof that Moon Door.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He tried to reason with her.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was--",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Shh.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
It's not your fault.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You could see it in the way she raised that boy.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Lord Royce!,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
This is hardly the time.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Apologies, my lady.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"And to you as well, Baelish.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
We treated you a bit harshly.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"You want justice, Lord Royce.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I can hardly complain about that.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I want the same.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"For Lysa, no.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
But for her son?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
They fought together to overcome the Mad King.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Are you questioning our courage?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I want to know which side you're on.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Who stands against him now?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Robb Stark is dead.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
More often they die young.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I adored Lysa with all my heart.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He needs to learn how to swing a sword.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
How to ride a horse.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

Men kill with steel.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
That's your stupid pride talking.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
It's why you'll never be a great killer.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(laughs),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I'd pay good money to see that.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(groans),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You should have let me burn it.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
It's a fleabite.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

The Red Viper of Dorne.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

I've never seen him fight.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Oh, he's going to die.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I'm going to die.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Oberyn believes in himself.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
That's putting it mildly.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
What's the punishment for regicide?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Drawing and quartering?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Hanging?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
- Breaking at the wheel?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Beheading.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Seems rather ordinary.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"And he was my nephew as well, so what is that?",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Fratricide is brothers.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Filicide is sons.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Nepoticide.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
That's the one.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Cousins.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Cousins, you're right.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
There is no word for cousin killing.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Well done.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Do you remember cousin Orson?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Orson Lannister?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Left him simple.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
- Simple?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Used to sit all day in the garden.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Crushing beetles with a rock.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(both grunting),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(chuckles),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Nothing made him happier.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Nothing made you happier.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"The joke wore thin, though.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
For you.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You drifted away.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I had other interests.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Yes, other interests.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
But I stayed with Orson.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Why?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I was curious.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Why was he smashing all those beetles?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
What did he get out of it?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
First thing I did was ask him.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?""",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He gave me an answer.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"""Smash the beetles.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Smash 'em.""",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(grunting),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I wasn't deterred.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I was the smartest person I knew.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
So I went to Maester Volarik's library.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Volarik.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Tried to touch me once.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Doesn't seem right.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
So I went back to the source.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
There was something happening there.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
But he wasn't mindless.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He had his reasons.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
And I became possessed with knowing what they were.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of...",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(grunting),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Did I hear dragon wings?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
No.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I heard...,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(grunting),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
And I still couldn't figureout why he was doing it.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Who gives a dusty f*ck about a bunch of beetles?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"Piles and piles of them, years and years of them.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I tried to stop Orson once.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He was twice your size.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"He just pushed me aside with a ""kuuh"" and kept on smashing.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
So what do you think?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Why did he do it?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
What was it all about?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I don't know.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(bells tolling),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Good luck today.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(door closes),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(crowd shouting),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Looks like very light armor.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I like to move around.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You could at least wear a helmet.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You shouldn't drink before a fight.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You learn this during your years in the fighting pits?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I always drink before a fight.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
It could get you killed.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
It could get me killed.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Today is not the day I die.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(crowd cheering),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You're going to fight that?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I'm going to kill that.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
He is the biggest man I've ever seen.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Thank the gods.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(horn blows),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this... man Tyrion Lannister.",8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
May the Mother grant them mercy.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
May the Father give them such justice as they deserve.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
And may the Warrior guide the hand...,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
- (horn blows),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
...of our champion--,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Don't leave me alone in this world.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Never.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
(crowd cheering),8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Have they told you who I am?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Some dead man.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I am the brother of Elia Martell.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city?,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
For you.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
I'm going to hear you confess before you die.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper
You raped my sister.,8,4,The Mountain and the Viper

How big were her feet?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
What do you want me to say?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
To be with someone.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

You're... I don't know.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I'm not a bleeding poet.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"No, you're really not.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
What did I get for it?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
An arrow six inches from my heart.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"There'll be arrows for all of us soon, I imagine.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
There will.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Go get some sleep, Sam.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

Many is the man who...,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I know you never f*cked a bear.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
You know you never f*cked a bear.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Right now I don't want to think about the bear you never f*cked.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow's heart.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
We could be waiting here a while.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Good.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
They came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Then they started hunting us down.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"This time, we're the ones doing the hunting.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
You've got a lot to say about killing.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Even more words than arrows.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"More, I reckon.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Yes, but none of those were your crow lover.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Maester Aemon.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

Let me help you.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Oh, no need.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Thousands of books and no eyes to read them.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
But you didn't answer my question.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
What are you reading?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Maester Faull.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Ah, the wildlings.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a wildling was this very library.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"But what he says about what they do, it's all true.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Love is the death of duty.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
He didn't listen and neither did you.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I don't love her.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Yes, you do.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
No.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Yes, you do.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I remember how it sounds.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I was in love once.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
You were?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"I'm sorry, Maester.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I didn't mean it like that.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Do you know who I was before I came here?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
What I could have been if I'd only said the word?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Of course you do.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
A future king always does.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
One of them succeeded.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I was very young.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Who was she?,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

I could tell you everything about her.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Who she was, how we met, the color of her eyes, and the shape of her nose.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
I can see her right in front of me.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
She's more real than you are.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Go to bed, Tarly.",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

I can't.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
"Sam, is that you?",9,4,The Watchers on the Wall
Yes.,9,4,The Watchers on the Wall

You sure?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"She's dyed her hair, but it's her.",2,5,The House of Black and White
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Littlefinger?,2,5,The House of Black and White
A bunch of knights with them.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Ten, I think. Too many.",2,5,The House of Black and White
"My Lady, I don't think this is...",2,5,The House of Black and White
Ready the horses!,2,5,The House of Black and White
We only have one horse.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Find more!,2,5,The House of Black and White
Do you like the taste?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Don't see what all the fuss is about.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Why do men love it so much?,2,5,The House of Black and White
It gives some men courage.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Does it give you courage?,2,5,The House of Black and White
That's far enough.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Lord Baelish.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Lady Sansa.,2,5,The House of Black and White
My name is Brienne of Tarth.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"We've met, with Renly Baratheon.",2,5,The House of Black and White
What did he say about you?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"He said, Your loyalty came free of charge.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Lady Sansa.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword.",2,5,The House of Black and White
I gave my word I will find you and protect you.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"I will shield your back and keep your counsel, and give my life for you if needs be.",2,5,The House of Black and White
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Please, lady Brienne.",2,5,The House of Black and White
No need for such formality.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I was.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Strange.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I knew Cat since the time we were children. She never mentioned you.,2,5,The House of Black and White
It was after Renly's murder.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Ah, yes.",2,5,The House of Black and White
You were accused of killing him.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I tried to save him.,2,5,The House of Black and White
But you were accused.,2,5,The House of Black and White
By men who did not see what happened.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And what did happen?,2,5,The House of Black and White
He was murdered by a shadow.,2,5,The House of Black and White
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.,2,5,The House of Black and White
A shadow?,2,5,The House of Black and White
With a face?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"This woman swore to protect Renly, she failed.",2,5,The House of Black and White
"She swore to protect your mother, she failed.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Why would you have any saying in her affairs?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Because I am her uncle.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death.,2,5,The House of Black and White
We're family now. And you are an outsider.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Forgive me, Lady Brienne.",2,5,The House of Black and White
But experience has made me wary of outsiders.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Lady Sansa... if we can have a word alone...,2,5,The House of Black and White
No.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Please, my Lady, if I can explain...",2,5,The House of Black and White
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding... bowing to the king.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Neither of us wanted to be there.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Sometimes we don't have a choice.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And sometimes we do.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You should leave.,2,5,The House of Black and White
We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone.,2,5,The House of Black and White
The roads in these parts aren't safe.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Why don't you stay?,2,5,The House of Black and White
I'm gonna ask you to stay.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Stop! Stop! After him!,2,5,The House of Black and White
Podrick!,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!",2,5,The House of Black and White
Stop!,2,5,The House of Black and White
That's a good boy. Come on.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Come on!,2,5,The House of Black and White
"No, no, no, stop!",2,5,The House of Black and White
Guess that means you're unarmed.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Don't! Put that down!,2,5,The House of Black and White
Podrick?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Yes, my Lady?",2,5,The House of Black and White
You can stand now.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Yes, my Lady.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Sansa Stark?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Wary of strangers, as she should be.",2,5,The House of Black and White
I saw her riding on the Eastroad with Littlefinger.,2,5,The House of Black and White
We'll follow them.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"My Lady... if both Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow.",2,5,The House of Black and White
I swore to their mother I would protect those girls.,2,5,The House of Black and White
They don't want your protection.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"No, my Lady.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Get your horse.,2,5,The House of Black and White
A summons from the Queen.,2,5,The House of Black and White
There are only two like it in the world.,2,5,The House of Black and White
The one I'm wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.,2,5,The House of Black and White
It's a threat.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Of course it's a threat.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"It's a threat, No note?",2,5,The House of Black and White
They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And every other tragedy that has befallen their accursed country.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Softer.,2,5,The House of Black and White
What?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Not so loud.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried I am speaking too loudly?,2,5,The House of Black and White
No one can know she's our daughter.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Then don't call her your daughter.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You've never been a father to her.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.",2,5,The House of Black and White
And what has your caution brought?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding, our only daughter shipped off to Dorne, our baby boy set to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden!",2,5,The House of Black and White
I'm gonna make things better.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You've never made anything better.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I'm going to Dorne.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And I'm bringing our daughter home.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back.,2,5,The House of Black and White
She's promised to his son.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I'm not going to ask him anything.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You go down there with an army it's an act of war.,2,5,The House of Black and White
No army.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Do you know where they're keeping her?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I'll find her.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Is there anything else, Your Grace?",2,5,The House of Black and White
You're going to Dorne.,2,5,The House of Black and White
A one-handed man.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Alone.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Who said I was going alone?,2,5,The House of Black and White
No sunfloweres. I don't like yellow.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Roses are very nice, definitely roses.",2,5,The House of Black and White
And music. I adore music.,2,5,The House of Black and White
But no flutes.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"I hate flutes. We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Then there's the food.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"The food is the most important thing, don't you agree?",2,5,The House of Black and White
We're gonna need pigeon pies.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?",2,5,The House of Black and White
Don't they?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Don't who?,2,5,The House of Black and White
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"They certainly do, my dear.",2,5,The House of Black and White
They certainly do.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"It's a fine place, isn't it?",2,5,The House of Black and White
A fine place.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I never thought I'd be settling down in a place like this.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You won't.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Pardon?,2,5,The House of Black and White
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"When mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.",2,5,The House of Black and White
She hates me.,2,5,The House of Black and White
She calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother's not looking.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You know what I think?,2,5,The House of Black and White
I think you're a good person.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And your sister is a mean person.,2,5,The House of Black and White
She is.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"I've been all over the world and if there's one thing I've learned, is that meanness comes around.",2,5,The House of Black and White
"People like your sister, they always get what's coming for them, eventually.",2,5,The House of Black and White
One way or another.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Who's that?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Jaime f*cking Lannister.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Ser Jaime?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I was very sorry to hear about your father.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Thank you.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"This is my betrothed, Lollys.",2,5,The House of Black and White
A pleasure.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Run along, love.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.,2,5,The House of Black and White
When are you planning on getting married?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Just get on with it.,2,5,The House of Black and White
On with what?,2,5,The House of Black and White
What you're here for.,2,5,The House of Black and White
There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.,2,5,The House of Black and White
It's very good for you.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Mmm.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"We've made a deal, your sister and I.",2,5,The House of Black and White
I would have advised against that.,2,5,The House of Black and White
How is this good for me?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Because you're going to come with me and help me with something important.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And when we return...,2,5,The House of Black and White
I'm gonna give you a much better girl and a much better castle.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Return from where?,2,5,The House of Black and White
As far south as south goes.,2,5,The House of Black and White
You are my queen.,2,5,The House of Black and White
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your...,2,5,The House of Black and White
Captain... let her pass.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Your brother was murdered... and you sit here in the Water Gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by a lord. That is no murder.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Your brother...,2,5,The House of Black and White
You don't have to remind me.,2,5,The House of Black and White
He was my brother long before he was anything to you.,2,5,The House of Black and White
What will you know about his death?,2,5,The House of Black and White
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And then?,2,5,The House of Black and White
You would have me go to war.,2,5,The House of Black and White
The whole country would have you go to war.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.,2,5,The House of Black and White
The Sand Snakes are with me.,2,5,The House of Black and White
We have the love of their people.,2,5,The House of Black and White
They will avenge their father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Oberyn is dead.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air.",2,5,The House of Black and White
How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Let me have her.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I loved my brother.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And you made him very happy.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"For that, you will always have a place in my heart.",2,5,The House of Black and White
But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Not here.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Not while I rule.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And how long would that be?,2,5,The House of Black and White
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.,2,5,The House of Black and White
'Course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"You haven't, have you?",2,5,The House of Black and White
"My Second Sons on the other hand... they drink, they whore, fight in streets, they blend in.",2,5,The House of Black and White
They overhear things in taverns.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Break a few fingers, overhear a few more things... before you know it...",2,5,The House of Black and White
No one here.,2,5,The House of Black and White
We go.,2,5,The House of Black and White
In a hurry?,2,5,The House of Black and White
You're afraid?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Unsullied fear nothing.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Right.,2,5,The House of Black and White
That's your problem.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"You understood fear once, long ago, but you forgot what it means.",2,5,The House of Black and White
Someone who's forgotten fear... has forgotten how to hide.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Fear is useful that way.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Sons of the Harpy... they want to put a collar back on my neck.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace...",2,5,The House of Black and White
you must kill him.,2,5,The House of Black and White
It would send a message.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I think you should exercise restraint...,2,5,The House of Black and White
Your Grace.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Why?,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Well, for one thing, he may have valuable information.",2,5,The House of Black and White
"Well, the Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.",2,5,The House of Black and White
How do you know that?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Because I questioned him.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And the information you did get... he is young and..,2,5,The House of Black and White
He is born free.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Why should he want to bring back slavery?,2,5,The House of Black and White
What did it do for him?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.,2,5,The House of Black and White
They pay him.,2,5,The House of Black and White
"Great families, afraid to do a thing.",2,5,The House of Black and White
They pay poor men to do it for them.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And how do you know this?,2,5,The House of Black and White
Everyone know this.,2,5,The House of Black and White
I don't know it.,2,5,The House of Black and White
And I'm the head of a great family.,2,5,The House of Black and White
We do not know what this man did or didn't do.,2,5,The House of Black and White
Valar morghulis.,3,5,High Sparrow
Valar dohaeris.,3,5,High Sparrow
I've been sweeping this floor for days.,3,5,High Sparrow
Good.,3,5,High Sparrow
I didn't come here to sweep floors.,3,5,High Sparrow
No? Why come than?,3,5,High Sparrow
You said that I could be your apprentice.,3,5,High Sparrow
You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.,3,5,High Sparrow
A man teaches a girl.,3,5,High Sparrow
Valar dohaeris. All men must serve.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Faceless men, most of all.",3,5,High Sparrow
I want to serve.,3,5,High Sparrow
A girl wants to serve herself.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well.",3,5,High Sparrow
A girl must become no-one.,3,5,High Sparrow
Which one is the Many-Faced God?,3,5,High Sparrow
"I see the Stranger, I see the Drowned God, I see the Weirwood Face.",3,5,High Sparrow
There is only one god.,3,5,High Sparrow
A girl knows his name.,3,5,High Sparrow
And no man know his gift.,3,5,High Sparrow
Where are they taking him?,3,5,High Sparrow
Queen Margaery!,3,5,High Sparrow
Queen Margaery!,3,5,High Sparrow
Queen Margaery!,3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm his, and he's mine.",3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm hers, and she's mine.",3,5,High Sparrow
From this day until the end of my days.,3,5,High Sparrow
From this day until the end of my days.,3,5,High Sparrow
Did I hurt you?,3,5,High Sparrow
No. You were lovely.,3,5,High Sparrow
It all happened so fast.,3,5,High Sparrow
Yes.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded like...",3,5,High Sparrow
"No, no, no... you're very sweet.",3,5,High Sparrow
The sweetest king who ever lived.,3,5,High Sparrow
"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.",3,5,High Sparrow
Wouldn't that be glorious?,3,5,High Sparrow
Shouldn't we rest a little while?,3,5,High Sparrow
"Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?",3,5,High Sparrow
Of course not.,3,5,High Sparrow
Are you hungry?,3,5,High Sparrow
Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice...?,3,5,High Sparrow
"No, I'm fine...",3,5,High Sparrow
I just want you all to myself.,3,5,High Sparrow
I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.,3,5,High Sparrow
King Tommen... it still sounds strange to me.,3,5,High Sparrow
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?,3,5,High Sparrow
So strange. Husband.,3,5,High Sparrow
Wife.,3,5,High Sparrow
Sometimes it feels odd.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, and it's all because my brother died.",3,5,High Sparrow
I understand.,3,5,High Sparrow
"But it's no your fault, you know that, don't you?",3,5,High Sparrow
You mustn't feel guilty.,3,5,High Sparrow
I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.,3,5,High Sparrow
Do you like to sail?,3,5,High Sparrow
I love to sail.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I do, too.",3,5,High Sparrow
"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.",3,5,High Sparrow
"I do, too.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds.",3,5,High Sparrow
Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home.,3,5,High Sparrow
"The capital is not for everyone, I suppose.",3,5,High Sparrow
Does your mother like it here?,3,5,High Sparrow
I don't think so.,3,5,High Sparrow
She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.,3,5,High Sparrow
It's so wonderful to have her watching over you.,3,5,High Sparrow
A lioness guiding her cub.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Well, but I'm a man now.",3,5,High Sparrow
You are.,3,5,High Sparrow
And the king.,3,5,High Sparrow
But you'll always be her baby-boy.,3,5,High Sparrow
I suppose.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind.",3,5,High Sparrow
And the horror she's had to endure.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father.",3,5,High Sparrow
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.,3,5,High Sparrow
She'll never let you out of her sight.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're very much in love.,3,5,High Sparrow
The first days of marriage are often so blissful.,3,5,High Sparrow
"She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?",3,5,High Sparrow
"Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot.",3,5,High Sparrow
Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell.,3,5,High Sparrow
Not that it matters.,3,5,High Sparrow
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?,3,5,High Sparrow
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.,3,5,High Sparrow
That's where you grew up.,3,5,High Sparrow
You always told me that you liked the people there better.,3,5,High Sparrow
You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.,3,5,High Sparrow
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?,3,5,High Sparrow
The way that you talked about it...,3,5,High Sparrow
I always thought that you missed it.,3,5,High Sparrow
That you... That it was your real home.,3,5,High Sparrow
This is my real home now.,3,5,High Sparrow
Where my family lives.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I want you to be happy, mother.",3,5,High Sparrow
I know that.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I know you do, my sweet boy.",3,5,High Sparrow
But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?,3,5,High Sparrow
"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?""",3,5,High Sparrow
"And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.""",3,5,High Sparrow
Mother.,3,5,High Sparrow
Welcome.,3,5,High Sparrow
Well don't you look lovely.,3,5,High Sparrow
Marriage agrees with you.,3,5,High Sparrow
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?,3,5,High Sparrow
I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.,3,5,High Sparrow
"No, no, I...I can't stay.",3,5,High Sparrow
I just wanted to let you know if... there is ever anything I can do for you.,3,5,High Sparrow
You are very sweet.,3,5,High Sparrow
Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.,3,5,High Sparrow
I absolutely adore him.,3,5,High Sparrow
You raised a gallant young man.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm forever grateful.,3,5,High Sparrow
Good.,3,5,High Sparrow
Good.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm glad to hear you're happy.,3,5,High Sparrow
Ecstatic. I really am.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag.",3,5,High Sparrow
I'll leave you to it then.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused.",3,5,High Sparrow
What's the proper way to address you now?,3,5,High Sparrow
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?,3,5,High Sparrow
There's no need for such formalities.,3,5,High Sparrow
"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.",3,5,High Sparrow
That'll be a lovely day.,3,5,High Sparrow
Imagine the celebrations.,3,5,High Sparrow
They'll ring the bells all day and night.,3,5,High Sparrow
Remember.,3,5,High Sparrow
Anything you need.,3,5,High Sparrow
We can't hold the North with terror alone.,3,5,High Sparrow
You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.",3,5,High Sparrow
Lord *** refused to pay.,3,5,High Sparrow
"He said the Warden of the North will always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.",3,5,High Sparrow
You left him no choice.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother.",3,5,High Sparrow
I made his son watch.,3,5,High Sparrow
And?,3,5,High Sparrow
The new Lord *** paid his taxes.,3,5,High Sparrow
I have something important to tell you.,3,5,High Sparrow
Stop eating and listen.,3,5,High Sparrow
We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us.,3,5,High Sparrow
Do you understand that?,3,5,High Sparrow
Our pact with the Lannisters...,3,5,High Sparrow
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.,3,5,High Sparrow
Tywin Lannister is dead.,3,5,High Sparrow
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.,3,5,High Sparrow
They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north.,3,5,High Sparrow
"If you think they will for us, you're a fool.",3,5,High Sparrow
"We become a great House by entering in alliances with other Houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Now the best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off, the best way is marriage.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride.",3,5,High Sparrow
"And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.",3,5,High Sparrow
That's Moat Cailin.,3,5,High Sparrow
Yes.,3,5,High Sparrow
"A bit shabby, isn't it?",3,5,High Sparrow
You've been here before.,3,5,High Sparrow
"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...",3,5,High Sparrow
Where are you taking me?,3,5,High Sparrow
Home.,3,5,High Sparrow
The Boltons have Winterfell.,3,5,High Sparrow
The marriage proposal...It wasn't for you?,3,5,High Sparrow
No.,3,5,High Sparrow
Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!,3,5,High Sparrow
He did.,3,5,High Sparrow
He serves the Lannisters.,3,5,High Sparrow
For now.,3,5,High Sparrow
I won't go.,3,5,High Sparrow
Winterfell is your home.,3,5,High Sparrow
Not anymore.,3,5,High Sparrow
Always. You're a Stark.,3,5,High Sparrow
Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark.,3,5,High Sparrow
The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.,3,5,High Sparrow
Your place is in the North.,3,5,High Sparrow
I can't marry him. You can't make me.,3,5,High Sparrow
He's a traitor. A murderer.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.,3,5,High Sparrow
"No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay.",3,5,High Sparrow
One day he'll be Warden of the North and...,3,5,High Sparrow
No!,3,5,High Sparrow
Sansa...,3,5,High Sparrow
"No, you can't make me.",3,5,High Sparrow
I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.,3,5,High Sparrow
I won't force you to do anything.,3,5,High Sparrow
Don't you know by now how much I care for you?,3,5,High Sparrow
"Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me.",3,5,High Sparrow
Listen.,3,5,High Sparrow
You've been running all your life.,3,5,High Sparrow
Terrible things happened to your family and you weep.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You sit alone in a dark room, mourning their fates.",3,5,High Sparrow
You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Stop being a bystander, you hear me? Stop running.",3,5,High Sparrow
There's no justice in the world.,3,5,High Sparrow
Not unless we make it.,3,5,High Sparrow
You loved your family.,3,5,High Sparrow
Avenge them.,3,5,High Sparrow
How do we get through there?,3,5,High Sparrow
We don't.,3,5,High Sparrow
We go around.,3,5,High Sparrow
It sets miles out of the way.,3,5,High Sparrow
We'll lose sight of them.,3,5,High Sparrow
Doesn't matter.,3,5,High Sparrow
I know where they're going.,3,5,High Sparrow
Don't you get a bit old for a squire?,3,5,High Sparrow
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?,3,5,High Sparrow
He hates that nickname.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?",3,5,High Sparrow
I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings.,3,5,High Sparrow
"One night, he had a bit too much to drink.",3,5,High Sparrow
"And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.",3,5,High Sparrow
He borrowed it?,3,5,High Sparrow
He wasn't a thief.,3,5,High Sparrow
He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking.,3,5,High Sparrow
I was drunk too.,3,5,High Sparrow
He gave me half the ham.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand.",3,5,High Sparrow
They hanged the man after noon.,3,5,High Sparrow
"They tied the noose for me too, but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne, so he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.",3,5,High Sparrow
Punishment?,3,5,High Sparrow
For both of you.,3,5,High Sparrow
It didn't seem that way.,3,5,High Sparrow
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.,3,5,High Sparrow
I guess all of your lords were very kind to you.,3,5,High Sparrow
All except me.,3,5,High Sparrow
Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen.,3,5,High Sparrow
You beat The Hound.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm proud to be your squire.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.,3,5,High Sparrow
If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You want to be a knight, Pod?",3,5,High Sparrow
Yes.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening.",3,5,High Sparrow
And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.,3,5,High Sparrow
Thank you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.",3,5,High Sparrow
I suppose that's more important.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?",3,5,High Sparrow
I was.,3,5,High Sparrow
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.,3,5,High Sparrow
He was.,3,5,High Sparrow
But how did you end up serving Renly?,3,5,High Sparrow
"When I was a girl, my father held a ball.",3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me.",3,5,High Sparrow
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom.",3,5,High Sparrow
And it was wonderful.,3,5,High Sparrow
None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was.,3,5,High Sparrow
The shaft each other and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance.,3,5,High Sparrow
Whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles.,3,5,High Sparrow
My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'd never been so happy.,3,5,High Sparrow
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.,3,5,High Sparrow
"And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer.",3,5,High Sparrow
They were toying with me.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Brienne the Beauty, they called me. Great joke.",3,5,High Sparrow
And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.,3,5,High Sparrow
A great lumbering beast.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Don't let them see your tears, he told me.",3,5,High Sparrow
"The nasty little sh1ts, nasty little sh1ts aren't worth crying over.",3,5,High Sparrow
He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.,3,5,High Sparrow
And he was the king's brother after all.,3,5,High Sparrow
But...wasn't he...,3,5,High Sparrow
Lord Tyrion said he was...,3,5,High Sparrow
"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot.",3,5,High Sparrow
"He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt.",3,5,High Sparrow
He saved me from being a joke.,3,5,High Sparrow
From that day until his last day.,3,5,High Sparrow
And I couldn't save him in return.,3,5,High Sparrow
Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.,3,5,High Sparrow
"One day, I will avenge King Renly.",3,5,High Sparrow
But you said a shadow murdered him.,3,5,High Sparrow
How do you fight a shadow?,3,5,High Sparrow
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.,3,5,High Sparrow
I know it was Stannis.,3,5,High Sparrow
I know it in my heart.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Stannis is a man, not a shadow.",3,5,High Sparrow
And a man... can be killed.,3,5,High Sparrow
Lord Commander.,3,5,High Sparrow
Your Grace.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'd like to speak alone.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Ollie is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.",3,5,High Sparrow
"I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience.",3,5,High Sparrow
"One day, he might command.",3,5,High Sparrow
Very well. Have you considered my offer?,3,5,High Sparrow
I have.,3,5,High Sparrow
And I thank you for it. You do me great honor.,3,5,High Sparrow
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.,3,5,High Sparrow
Say the word and you will be.,3,5,High Sparrow
But I have to refuse you.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.,3,5,High Sparrow
My place is here.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family.,3,5,High Sparrow
Take back the castle where you grew up.,3,5,High Sparrow
To rule the North.,3,5,High Sparrow
I wish I could fight beside you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Believe me, I do.",3,5,High Sparrow
But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood.,3,5,High Sparrow
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're as stubborn as your father.,3,5,High Sparrow
And as honorable.,3,5,High Sparrow
I can imagine no higher praise.,3,5,High Sparrow
I didn't mean it as praise.,3,5,High Sparrow
Honor got your father killed.,3,5,High Sparrow
"But if your mind is made up, I won't try to persuade you.",3,5,High Sparrow
Can I ask Your Grace how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?,3,5,High Sparrow
Are you bored of us already?,3,5,High Sparrow
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.,3,5,High Sparrow
We will never forget that.,3,5,High Sparrow
But it's a question of survival.,3,5,High Sparrow
Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Mm, winter is coming.",3,5,High Sparrow
I know it.,3,5,High Sparrow
We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.,3,5,High Sparrow
Before the snows trap us here.,3,5,High Sparrow
And the wildlings?,3,5,High Sparrow
"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it.",3,5,High Sparrow
I leave their fate to you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You could execute them, that's the safest course.",3,5,High Sparrow
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was.,3,5,High Sparrow
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Most of the brothers, yes.",3,5,High Sparrow
There's little love for the free folk here.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're Lord Commander.,3,5,High Sparrow
Your decision.,3,5,High Sparrow
You have many enemies in Castle Black.,3,5,High Sparrow
Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?,3,5,High Sparrow
Give him command of Eastwach-by-the-Sea.,3,5,High Sparrow
I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.,3,5,High Sparrow
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.,3,5,High Sparrow
He sees something in you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.",3,5,High Sparrow
I'm sorry I disappointed him.,3,5,High Sparrow
The king is a complicated man.,3,5,High Sparrow
But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.,3,5,High Sparrow
As long as he's ruling them.,3,5,High Sparrow
He's the one true king.,3,5,High Sparrow
He has the blood right to that throne.,3,5,High Sparrow
I sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.,3,5,High Sparrow
Have you now?,3,5,High Sparrow
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?,3,5,High Sparrow
I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.,3,5,High Sparrow
Night gathers and now my watch begins...,3,5,High Sparrow
"Not that bit, the bit at the end.",3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men.",3,5,High Sparrow
I pledge my life...,3,5,High Sparrow
"Okay, that's enough.",3,5,High Sparrow
Shield that guards the realm of men.,3,5,High Sparrow
That's what you swore to be.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Now I'm not a learned man, the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world.",3,5,High Sparrow
It just might mean wading in the muck and getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be done.,3,5,High Sparrow
And what needs to be done?,3,5,High Sparrow
"As long as the Boltons rule the North, the North will suffer.",3,5,High Sparrow
Just one man's opinion.,3,5,High Sparrow
What do you want?,3,5,High Sparrow
Who are you?,3,5,High Sparrow
What?,3,5,High Sparrow
"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect.",3,5,High Sparrow
Who are you?,3,5,High Sparrow
No one. Ou! c**t!,3,5,High Sparrow
"A lie, a sad little lie.",3,5,High Sparrow
Who are you?,3,5,High Sparrow
"I told you, I'm no...",3,5,High Sparrow
Do that again and...,3,5,High Sparrow
Who are you?,3,5,High Sparrow
You're about to find out.,3,5,High Sparrow
What are you doing?,3,5,High Sparrow
We're only playing.,3,5,High Sparrow
The game of faces.,3,5,High Sparrow
That girl is not ready.,3,5,High Sparrow
Clearly not.,3,5,High Sparrow
I am ready.,3,5,High Sparrow
For what?,3,5,High Sparrow
For every you want to be a Faceless Man.,3,5,High Sparrow
To be no one.,3,5,High Sparrow
Whose sword is that?,3,5,High Sparrow
It belongs to Arya Stark.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver.",3,5,High Sparrow
A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?,3,5,High Sparrow
What do you do with them after you wash them?,3,5,High Sparrow
Open gates!,3,5,High Sparrow
Hold up!,3,5,High Sparrow
"Lady Sansa, welcome.",3,5,High Sparrow
Lord Bolton.,3,5,High Sparrow
"May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?",3,5,High Sparrow
It's an honor to meet you.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.,3,5,High Sparrow
You must want to wash.,3,5,High Sparrow
Thank you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Welcome home, Lady Stark.",3,5,High Sparrow
The North remembers.,3,5,High Sparrow
Sam.,3,5,High Sparrow
Maester Aemon?,3,5,High Sparrow
He apologizes for not being here.,3,5,High Sparrow
He's not feeling well.,3,5,High Sparrow
Take good care of him.,3,5,High Sparrow
I will drink it then.,3,5,High Sparrow
He'll lose.,3,5,High Sparrow
"As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.",3,5,High Sparrow
First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.,3,5,High Sparrow
Brian.,3,5,High Sparrow
It seems like a good job for a ginger.,3,5,High Sparrow
Ser Alliser.,3,5,High Sparrow
You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black.,3,5,High Sparrow
You proved your valour many times over by defending the Wall from the wildling attack.,3,5,High Sparrow
I name you First Ranger.,3,5,High Sparrow
Lord Janos.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.,3,5,High Sparrow
Greyguard is a ruin.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.",3,5,High Sparrow
Restore it as best you can.,3,5,High Sparrow
First Builder Yarwyck can spare...,3,5,High Sparrow
I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.,3,5,High Sparrow
Keep your ruin.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Alright, alright.",3,5,High Sparrow
Enough of that.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You mistake me, my Lord.",3,5,High Sparrow
"That was a command, not an offer.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.",3,5,High Sparrow
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.,3,5,High Sparrow
Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.,3,5,High Sparrow
I will not have it.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You hear me, boy?",3,5,High Sparrow
I will not have it!,3,5,High Sparrow
You refusing to obey my order?,3,5,High Sparrow
You can stick your order up your b*st*rd arse.,3,5,High Sparrow
Take Lord Janos outside.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Ollie, bring me my sword.",3,5,High Sparrow
You cannot do this!,3,5,High Sparrow
Get your hands off me!,3,5,High Sparrow
You're scum! All of you!,3,5,High Sparrow
The boy thinks he can frighten me?,3,5,High Sparrow
"He's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.",3,5,High Sparrow
A disgrace!,3,5,High Sparrow
"I have friends, important friends in the capital!",3,5,High Sparrow
You'll see!,3,5,High Sparrow
"If you have any last words, my Lord... now is the time.",3,5,High Sparrow
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander!,3,5,High Sparrow
"We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said.",3,5,High Sparrow
I was wrong!,3,5,High Sparrow
"My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy!",3,5,High Sparrow
I'll go! I will!,3,5,High Sparrow
Please.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm afraid.,3,5,High Sparrow
I've always been afraid.,3,5,High Sparrow
"You have served us well, my son.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Thank you, Father!",3,5,High Sparrow
Which of the Seven will you worship today?,3,5,High Sparrow
The Maiden...where is the Maiden?,3,5,High Sparrow
And the Stranger.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Two is extra, you realize...",3,5,High Sparrow
"Yes, yes.",3,5,High Sparrow
What are you doing?,3,5,High Sparrow
This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...,3,5,High Sparrow
You have profaned our Faith.,3,5,High Sparrow
The Faith of our fathers and forefathers.,3,5,High Sparrow
I am the High Septon of the...,3,5,High Sparrow
You are a sinner.,3,5,High Sparrow
And you shall be punished.,3,5,High Sparrow
Sinner! Sinner!,3,5,High Sparrow
Sinner! Repent!,3,5,High Sparrow
Sinner! Sinner!,3,5,High Sparrow
Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!,3,5,High Sparrow
Sinner! Shame on you! Sinner!,3,5,High Sparrow
Sinner!,3,5,High Sparrow
"Your Grace, Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell...",3,5,High Sparrow
"Uh, it doesn't matter.",3,5,High Sparrow
As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and I am their foremost servant in this world.,3,5,High Sparrow
An insult to me is an insult to the Gods.,3,5,High Sparrow
An assault on my person is an assault on our very religion.,3,5,High Sparrow
You were assaulted?,3,5,High Sparrow
I was.,3,5,High Sparrow
By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows.,3,5,High Sparrow
"And they humiliated me, they... they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones.",3,5,High Sparrow
I am lucky to be alive.,3,5,High Sparrow
I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.,3,5,High Sparrow
"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.",3,5,High Sparrow
I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.,3,5,High Sparrow
Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.,3,5,High Sparrow
So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?,3,5,High Sparrow
A man's private affairs ought to stay private.,3,5,High Sparrow
"What do you want from us, High Septon?",3,5,High Sparrow
Justice!,3,5,High Sparrow
I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throw them in the black cells.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I ask that you execute their leader, the so-called High Sparrow.",3,5,High Sparrow
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.,3,5,High Sparrow
If he goes unpunished...,3,5,High Sparrow
And where do I find this man?,3,5,High Sparrow
This High Sparrow?,3,5,High Sparrow
"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people.",3,5,High Sparrow
Where can I find the High Sparrow?,3,5,High Sparrow
Seven blessings...,3,5,High Sparrow
Thank the Gods.,3,5,High Sparrow
Just a little more.,3,5,High Sparrow
Thank you for the soup.,3,5,High Sparrow
The young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?,3,5,High Sparrow
High Sparrow?,3,5,High Sparrow
"Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?",3,5,High Sparrow
"Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle.",3,5,High Sparrow
"So, it's meant to...",3,5,High Sparrow
We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us.,3,5,High Sparrow
The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some so they belittle me.,3,5,High Sparrow
Seven blessings to you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Seven blessings to you, my dear.",3,5,High Sparrow
"It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear.",3,5,High Sparrow
Far easier than hers.,3,5,High Sparrow
Why no shoes?,3,5,High Sparrow
Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.,3,5,High Sparrow
We all do that.,3,5,High Sparrow
It stops us from forgetting who we really are.,3,5,High Sparrow
Is that why you came to King's Landing?,3,5,High Sparrow
To remind everyone?,3,5,High Sparrow
Everyone? I have a hard time reminding myself.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Well, I tell them no one's special.",3,5,High Sparrow
They think I'm special for telling them so.,3,5,High Sparrow
Perhaps they're right.,3,5,High Sparrow
"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it?",3,5,High Sparrow
The Gods sent you here to tempt me?,3,5,High Sparrow
I hope not.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'd assumed you'd only come here to arrest me.,3,5,High Sparrow
For that incident with the High Septon.,3,5,High Sparrow
"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?",3,5,High Sparrow
Hypocrisy is a boil.,3,5,High Sparrow
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.",3,5,High Sparrow
The High Septon came to speak to me today.,3,5,High Sparrow
"He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.",3,5,High Sparrow
I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.,3,5,High Sparrow
My thoughts on the matter align with your own.,3,5,High Sparrow
"The High Septon's behaviour was corosive, as was his attitude.",3,5,High Sparrow
Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside.,3,5,High Sparrow
So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead.,3,5,High Sparrow
The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.,3,5,High Sparrow
"If one collapses, so does the other.",3,5,High Sparrow
You must do everything necessary to protect one another.,3,5,High Sparrow
Your Grace.,3,5,High Sparrow
Send a message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie or wherever he's slythering about.,3,5,High Sparrow
"At once, Your Grace.",3,5,High Sparrow
How's your work coming along?,3,5,High Sparrow
Very well.,3,5,High Sparrow
You've made progress?,3,5,High Sparrow
More than I've expected.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Still a way to go, but...",3,5,High Sparrow
Very good. I'll leave you to it then.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediate"".",3,5,High Sparrow
Shh...,3,5,High Sparrow
"Easy, friend.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Come on, children.",3,5,High Sparrow
She really is lovely.,3,5,High Sparrow
I hope I can make her happy.,3,5,High Sparrow
I hope so too.,3,5,High Sparrow
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.,3,5,High Sparrow
She suffered enough.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'll never hurt her.,3,5,High Sparrow
You have my word.,3,5,High Sparrow
I've heard very little about you.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.",3,5,High Sparrow
I haven't been a lord very long.,3,5,High Sparrow
I was a b*st*rd.,3,5,High Sparrow
And you're not anymore.,3,5,High Sparrow
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish.",3,5,High Sparrow
I'm forever in your debt.,3,5,High Sparrow
He seems pleased.,3,5,High Sparrow
Shouldn't he be?,3,5,High Sparrow
I assure you she's still a virgin.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Inspect her, if you must.",3,5,High Sparrow
I leave that to the brothel keeper.,3,5,High Sparrow
"It's her name I need, not her virtue.",3,5,High Sparrow
I have delivered everything I've promised.,3,5,High Sparrow
And you prepared for the consequences.,3,5,High Sparrow
When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.,3,5,High Sparrow
The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.,3,5,High Sparrow
Tywin is dead.,3,5,High Sparrow
He kept his house in power through sheer will.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.",3,5,High Sparrow
The Queen will be enraged.,3,5,High Sparrow
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.",3,5,High Sparrow
"You noticed, still as friends men in important places, whom she can ask for favours.",3,5,High Sparrow
"A message for you, from Cersei Lannister.",3,5,High Sparrow
"A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.",3,5,High Sparrow
"A message for me, you say.",3,5,High Sparrow
Strange that the seal is broken.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish.",3,5,High Sparrow
"If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance.",3,5,High Sparrow
Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them.",3,5,High Sparrow
Why gamble with your position?,3,5,High Sparrow
Every ambitious move is a gamble.,3,5,High Sparrow
You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart.,3,5,High Sparrow
It appears that your gamble paid off.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're Warden of the North.,3,5,High Sparrow
I had Tywin Lannister backing.,3,5,High Sparrow
Who supports me now? You?,3,5,High Sparrow
The Eyrie is mine.,3,5,High Sparrow
"The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.",3,5,High Sparrow
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.,3,5,High Sparrow
Cersei will expect a reply.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'd like to read the reply.,3,5,High Sparrow
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,3,5,High Sparrow
Volantis is a large city.,3,5,High Sparrow
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,3,5,High Sparrow
The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundred fold.,3,5,High Sparrow
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.,3,5,High Sparrow
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind.,3,5,High Sparrow
I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.,3,5,High Sparrow
It's a perfectly good face.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm losing my mind.,3,5,High Sparrow
"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than...",3,5,High Sparrow
"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros.",3,5,High Sparrow
What am I?,3,5,High Sparrow
One more drunk dwarf.,3,5,High Sparrow
We have to go now. Come on.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Hold it, hold it!",3,5,High Sparrow
Slaves.,3,5,High Sparrow
Yes.,3,5,High Sparrow
The Volantene masters are very organized.,3,5,High Sparrow
Flies for dung shovelers.,3,5,High Sparrow
Hammers for builders.,3,5,High Sparrow
Tears for whores.,3,5,High Sparrow
Lest they forget.,3,5,High Sparrow
We should keep moving.,3,5,High Sparrow
The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.,3,5,High Sparrow
This one's much better looking.,3,5,High Sparrow
Stone men.,3,5,High Sparrow
Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer.,3,5,High Sparrow
You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.,3,5,High Sparrow
We're going to meet the Saviour.,3,5,High Sparrow
You should have told me.,3,5,High Sparrow
Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?,3,5,High Sparrow
Come on.,3,5,High Sparrow
Let's find a brothel.,3,5,High Sparrow
It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.,3,5,High Sparrow
See? We blend right in.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Just two more travellers, mad with lust.",3,5,High Sparrow
Thank you.,3,5,High Sparrow
Curious hair.,3,5,High Sparrow
The Mother of Dragons.,3,5,High Sparrow
It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.,3,5,High Sparrow
Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.,3,5,High Sparrow
What makes you ***?,3,5,High Sparrow
The magic.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Well, she's taken.",3,5,High Sparrow
Where're you going?,3,5,High Sparrow
I need to speak to someone with hair.,3,5,High Sparrow
Hello?,3,5,High Sparrow
Hello.,3,5,High Sparrow
You've got no drink.,3,5,High Sparrow
You've got no money.,3,5,High Sparrow
Do I look like a man without money?,3,5,High Sparrow
Never trust looks.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world.",3,5,High Sparrow
But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh?,3,5,High Sparrow
"I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.",3,5,High Sparrow
You like her?,3,5,High Sparrow
They all like her.,3,5,High Sparrow
They all want to f*ck a queen.,3,5,High Sparrow
Because they never met a queen.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're just saying that.,3,5,High Sparrow
You know how to spot a liar.,3,5,High Sparrow
"If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.",3,5,High Sparrow
Why?,3,5,High Sparrow
Because you have a skeptical mind.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Alright, then. I'm warning you. You're gonna have to wash you first.",3,5,High Sparrow
Come on.,3,5,High Sparrow
"I'm...I'm sorry, I can't.",3,5,High Sparrow
Of course you can.,3,5,High Sparrow
You're shy.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm not.,3,5,High Sparrow
Have another drink.,3,5,High Sparrow
"Gladly, but this, I can't do.",3,5,High Sparrow
"Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am.",3,5,High Sparrow
I hope it passes.,3,5,High Sparrow
What will I do in my spare time?,3,5,High Sparrow
"Go for a piss, let it stopped No need to worry, I was just... Oh...",3,5,High Sparrow
I thought you were someone else.,3,5,High Sparrow
Show is almost over.,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.,3,5,High Sparrow
You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and...,3,5,High Sparrow
I'm taking you to the Queen.,3,5,High Sparrow
Is that Estermont?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Tarth, Ser Jaime.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The Sapphire Isle.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Why are we on a merchant ship?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Why no Lannister sails?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You ever been to Dorne?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
No.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I have.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and f*ck, f*ck and fight.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You should be happy to go back.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for f*cking.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
It's how the two work together.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Not after we've kidnapped their princess.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
We are not kidnapping their princess.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family, Your niece?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I've been doing this sort of thing a long time.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I'm good at it.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
That's why you're here.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I know.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Unlike most folks, you actually got one.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Because I don't want to start a war.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
It has to be me.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not...",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
It has to be me.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You set your brother free, didn't you?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I bet your sister didn't like that.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Varys set him free.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Well... if you ever see the little fucker, give him my regards.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He murdered my father.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And then I'll give him your regards.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Given the expensive rebuilding of...,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How much can the Crown afford?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"With winter coming, half what they ask.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Less.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You're the Master of Coin.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How do we pay them?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"House Tyrell could front the gold and the... the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You've already given us too much.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Absolutely.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
In person.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Me?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"I will be honored, Your Grace.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
A valiant Kingsguard?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Please express...,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Of course, of course, I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Not small enough.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
No.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The old High Septon would have asked the vintage.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"But the truth is, I don't like the taste.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How may I serve?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Silent sisters raped.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you find worthy.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
An army and service to the Gods themselves.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"And to you, of course.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
As the chosen representative of the Seven.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
An honor I've never expected.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Or indeed, ever wished for.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Which is why you were chosen.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You and I both know how the world works.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Too often the wicked or the wealthiest be on the reach of justice.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
All sinners are equal before the Gods.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our own midst?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Shielded by gold and privilege.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
May the Father judge him justly.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Help me! Help me!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Aah!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Cocksucker!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Boy fucker!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You barbaric filth!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Please, please, I'll pay!",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I'll pay all of you.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Yes, you will!",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Seize him.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Get your hands off of me.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Who do you think you are?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Justice.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Why is my brother in a cell?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I--I don't know.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I--I didn't order it.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
We both know who did.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Are you saying my mother is behind this?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Arresting my brother is her revenge.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Aren't you and mother getting along?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Oh, my sweet, sweet King.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Do you have any affection for me at all?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Of course I do.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You're my Queen.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I'll set him free for you.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You promise?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Did I arrest him?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Well, no...",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
But you armed the Faith Militant.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You gave the High Sparrow an army.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I did.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And your wife has every right to criticize.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Then... can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I told you I am not holding Ser Loras.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Halt!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
b*st*rd!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You're an abomination!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You're born of sin!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Filthy b*st*rd!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
We'll find another way.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Abomination!,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
My Queen.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Are you? When?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I--I don't know.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You don't know?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He was praying just now.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I have to send word to Grandmother.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Will you come back later?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"I need to be wit my family, Your Grace.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Of course.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You think highly of this boy.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Good.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
A b*st*rd by some tavern slut.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I should have given you a son.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Not your fault.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Whose then?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I gave you nothing but weakness.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And deformity.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
My Lady.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Her father is the Lord's chosen King.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And her father's blood runs through her veins.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You march on Winterfell soon.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
We must.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
To beat the snows.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I hope you won't make that mistake again.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I won't.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I need you.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You only need faith, my King.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"And you, my Lady, what do you need?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
To serve my Lord.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Lord Ashford.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Lenny Coalfield.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Lord Smallwood.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Never even heard of these people.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
They haven't heard of you either.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
But we need men and they have some.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How many men does this Lord *** have to send us?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
More than Lord Weebly.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Not him.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Then who?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And Roose Bolton is the Warden of...,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He murdered my brother.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Apologies, my Lady.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Lord Commander.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How can I help you?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Come with us when we ride south.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
None of us know the castle as well as you do.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Winterfell was your home once.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Castle Black is my home now.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
There's only one war.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Life against death.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Come.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Let me show what you're fighting for.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You're gonna show me some vision in the fire.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Forgive me, my Lady.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
But I don't trust in visions.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
No visions.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
No magic.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Just life.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Do you feel my heart beating?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The Lord of Light made us male and female.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Two parts of a greater whole.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You're not joining this power.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I don't think Stannis would like that very much.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Then we shouldn't tell him.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I can't.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Why?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I swore a vow.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I loved another.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The dead don't need lovers.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Only the living.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I know.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
But I still love her.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You know nothing, Jon Snow.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Are you lonely?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Just bored.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Were you bored a lot, too?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I know Castle Black is no place for a child.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I like it.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I thought I'd be left at home.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I know mother didn't want to bring me.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Why do you say that?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"She told me ""I don't want to bring you.""",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
She shouldn't have said that.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Are you ashamed of me, father?",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"When you were an infant, the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
His goods were junk except for one wooden doll.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
No doubt he'd heard of your birth.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And assumed new fathers were easy targets.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You pressed it to your cheek.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I was told you would die.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Or worse.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The grayscale would go slow.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I told them all to go to hell.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I called in every maester on this side of the world.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Every healer, every apothecary.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
They stopped the disease and saved your life.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And you are my daughter.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I thought I might find you here.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Your Aunt Lyanna.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
My father never talked about her.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
They say she was beautiful.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I saw her once.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"I was a boy, living with your mother's family.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Everyone was there.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon, and Lyanna. She was already promised to Robert.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How handsome he was.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
I've never seen so many people so quiet.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Blue was frost.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
"Yes, he chose her.",4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Come.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy

King's Landing?,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy

Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy
He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way.,4,5,The Sons Of The Harpy

MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA.)",6,6,Blood of My Blood

The rider's horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horse's bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA.)",6,6,Blood of My Blood

High Sparrow: You're afraid for her?,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Tommen: Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
High Sparrow: She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Tommen: She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.,6,6,Blood of My Blood

Margaery: He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.,6,6,Blood of My Blood

(MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.),6,6,Blood of My Blood
Tommen: I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Margaery: Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.",6,6,Blood of My Blood

Tommen: What about Loras?,6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Margaery: I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.",6,6,Blood of My Blood

Dickon: Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?,6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Sam: Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say ""we,"" it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.",6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Melessa (to Gilly): I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.",6,6,Blood of My Blood

Randyll: I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
(SAM puts down his utensils.),6,6,Blood of My Blood
Randyll: Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Melessa: Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.",6,6,Blood of My Blood
Gilly: He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
(DICKON laughs.),6,6,Blood of My Blood
Dickon: There's no such thing.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Gilly: I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Randyll: Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Gilly: The Night's Watch came to our keep.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Randyll: Where?,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Sam: Gilly.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Gilly: North of the Wall.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
Randyll: North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?,6,6,Blood of My Blood
(RANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.),6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Randyll: It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A b*st*rd. A half-breed b*st*rd. Your invitation into our home.",6,6,Blood of My Blood

Melessa: You dishonor yourself.,6,6,Blood of My Blood
"Randyll (to Sam): Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The b*st*rd will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.",6,6,Blood of My Blood

I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours.
